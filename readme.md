Your code includes several key components in a pipeline for collecting and analyzing Reddit comments about medications. Here's a brief description of each class and their primary functions:

RedditPull: 
	This class is responsible for collecting comments from Reddit using the PRAW and Pushshift APIs. It also preprocesses the comments by removing links, numbers, punctuation, and splitting the comments into smaller chunks.

ADRClassifier: 
	This class uses a pretrained model to classify whether a comment contains an adverse drug reaction (ADR) or not. It includes custom Dataset and DataLoader classes for handling the input data.

ADRLabeler: 
	This class is responsible for labeling the drug name and words or phrases indicating an ADR using a SequenceTagger model.

ADRLinker: 
	This class links drugs and ADRs syntactically, creating a final output DataFrame that summarizes the relationships between drugs and their ADRs.

The run_pipeline function runs each step in the pipeline, starting with pulling comments from Reddit and ending with linking drugs and ADRs. The output is saved as a CSV file named linked_data.csv.

To execute the pipeline, the main part of your script takes a medication name as input and calls the run_pipeline function with the given medication.
