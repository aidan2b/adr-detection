Everything O
actually O
says O
that O
mdma O
may O
even O
help O
with O
ocd B-ADR
. O

I O
know O
you O
've O
pretty O
much O
taken O
care O
of O
the O
OCD B-ADR
, O
but O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
knew O
that O
. O

As O
long O
as O
your O
off O
the O
Prozac B-DRUG
there O
's O
no O
problem O
there O
. O

 

 O
If O
you O
do O
use O
some O
MDMA O
go O
light O
on O
it O
to O
see O
how O
you O
do O
and O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
very O
often O
, O
like O
months O
in O
between O
. O

MDMA O
is O
one O
of O
the O
hardest O
drugs O
on O
the O
brain O
and O
can O
burn O
you O
out O
quickly O
if O
mis O
- O
used O
. O



 O
If O
you O
have O
to O
go O
back O
on O
prozac B-DRUG
and O
take O
MDMA O
the O
mdms O
's O
effect O
will O
diminish O
because O
the O
prozac B-DRUG
and O
mdma O
are O
working O
on O
some O
of O
the O
same O
receptors O
. O

MDMA O
uses O
up O
a O
lot O
of O
serotonin O
, O
so O
if O
it O
's O
not O
there O
you O
do O
n't O
trip O
so O
well O
. O

That O
's O
where O
the O
problems O
can O
begin O
. O


If O

doesn’t O
give O
you O

then O
Primary O

 O
You O

How O
is O
that O
not O
exciting O
? O


I O
get O
the O
flashes O
of O
light O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

I O
’ll O
be O
laying O
in O
bed O
trying O
to O
fall O
asleep O
and O
then O
see O
one O
. O

It O
’s O
always O
makes O
me O
think O
a O
camera O
went O
off O
or O
something O
. O

Optic B-ADR
neuritis I-ADR
was O
my O
first O
symptom O
too O
, O
back O
in O
2018 O
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
since O
then O

I O
was O
on O
1 O
mg O
klonopin B-DRUG
daily O
for O
two O
months O
. O

  O
I O
then O
tapered O
slowly O
over O
6 O
months O
listening O
to O
my O
body O
. O

  O
Took O
.125 O
drops O
down O
to O
.5 O
mg O
a O
day O
. O

  O
Then O
.0625 O
drops O
down O
to O
.0625 O
daily O
. O

  O
Then O
down O
to O
.0325 O
for O
two O
weeks O
. O

  O
Every O
drop O
had O
2 O
- O
3 O
weeks O
breaks O
between O
drops O
. O

  O
I O
was O
on O
60 O
mg O
of O
propanolol B-DRUG
and O
60 O
mg O
buspirone B-DRUG
before O
tapering O
. O

  O
Doc O
put O
me O
on O
7.5 O
mirtazapine B-DRUG
when O
I O
was O
about O
70 O
% O
through O
taper O
. O



 O
It O
was O
n’t O
easy O
per O
say O
, O
but O
I O
’ve O
done O
harder O
things O
. O

  O
Increase O
anxiety B-ADR
was O
main O
symptom O
. O

  O
Also O
had O
some O
tinnitus B-ADR
, O
numbness B-ADR
, O
crawling B-ADR
skins I-ADR
, O
sleep O
was O
n’t O
good O
, O
an O
other O
symptoms B-ADR
that O
waxed O
and O
wane O
through O
the O
taper O
. O

  O
Hardest O
part O
was O
waiting O
for O
“ O
something O
” O
to O
happen O
or O
something O
to O
go O
“ O
crazy O
. O

” O
  O
Guess O
what O
, O
it O
never O
did O
. O

  O
I O
also O
have O
weekly O
appts O
with O
my O
psychologist O
to O
talk O
about O
these O
things O
. O

 

 O
I O
’m O
just O
over O
50 O
days O
off O
. O

  O
Nothing O
escalated O
after O
I O
jumped O
. O

  O
Most O
symptoms O
remained O
exactly O
the O
same O
for O
the O
first O
few O
weeks O
after O
jump O
. O

  O
Since O
then O
things O
are O
trending O
up O
. O

  O
I O
worked O
through O
all O
of O
it O
, O
but O
did O
take O
some O
mental O
health O
days O
. O



 O
I O
know O
I O
’m O
not O
the O
longest O
user O
or O
highest O
dosage O
, O
but O
reading O
stories O
online O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
have O
all O
the O
same O
issues O
. O

  O
If O
most O
of O
these O
stories O
are O
8/9/10s O
on O
the O
bad O
scale O
, O
I O
would O
say O
my O
worst O
days O
were O
a O
5 O
or O
6 O
, O
but O
most O
were O
2 O
or O
3s O
. O


I O
started O
having O
symptoms O
at O
around O
the O
same O
age O
, O
I O
can O
definitely O
relate O
to O
the O
feeling O
of O
mourning O
the O
young O
adulthood O
you O
should O
have O
been O
able O
to O
enjoy O
( O
and O
feeling O
scared O
and O
overwhelmed O
by O
the O
thought O
of O
things O
getting O
worse O
) O
. O

But O
here O
’s O
a O
silver O
lining O
: O
the O
earlier O
you O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
, O
the O
better O
! O

And O
you O
got O
yours O
really O
early O
, O
it O
took O
me O
10 O
years O
! O

Getting O
on O
the O
right O
meds O
can O
make O
a O
world O
of O
difference O
and O
prevent O
a O
lot O
of O
damage O
from O
occurring O
, O
slowing O
the O
progression O
of O
illness O
. O



 O
There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
helpful O
medications O
out O
there O
, O
and O
new O
meds O
are O
being O
developed O
all O
the O
time O
for O
autoimmune O
disorders O
. O

Do O
n’t O
lose O
hope O
, O
just O
do O
what O
you O
can O
! O

Stay O
as O
active O
as O
possible O
( O
which O
will O
be O
much O
easier O
since O
you O
’re O
diagnosed O
and O
can O
get O
actually O
helpful O
medications O
) O
and O
that O
will O
also O
help O
. O



 O
As O
for O
your O
other O
questions O
, O
RA O
is O
n’t O
terminal O
. O

It O
should O
n’t O
directly O
affect O
your O
life O
expectancy O
. O

Whether O
or O
not O
you O
’ll O
lose O
mobility O
is O
related O
to O
the O
severity O
and O
progression O
of O
your O
illness O
, O
as O
well O
as O
your O
affected O
joints O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
think O
most O
people O
with O
RA O
end O
up O
in O
wheelchairs O
before O
they O
’re O
elderly O
, O
especially O
if O
they O
are O
taking O
meds O
, O
and O
not O
everyone O
even O
does O
. O

And O
you O
also O
have O
to O
remember O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
elderly O
people O
today O
did O
n’t O
get O
to O
start O
taking O
modern O
immunosuppressants O
/ O
medications O
when O
they O
were O
21 O
, O
so O
they O
likely O
accrued O
more O
damage O
. O

You O
may O
lose O
some O
fine O
motor O
control O
in O
your O
hands O
due O
to O
stiffness B-ADR
, O
but O
it O
just O
depends O
. O



 O
As O
for O
having O
kids O
, O
we O
do O
n’t O
know O
for O
sure O
if O
it O
actually O
affects O
fertility O
. O

You O
may O
take O
longer O
to O
conceive O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
by O
no O
means O
a O
guarantee O
that O
you O
ca O
n’t O
have O
kids O
. O

Some O
medications O
( O
like O
methotrexate B-DRUG
) O
can O
not O
be O
taken O
if O
you O
’re O
currently O
trying O
to O
get O
pregnant O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
fine O
to O
take O
until O
you O
do O
start O
trying O
to O
conceive O
. O

Other O
medications O
, O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
are O
likely O
safe O
to O
continue O
during O
pregnancy O
, O
at O
least O
according O
to O
my O
rheumatologist O
( O
and O
my O
psychiatrist O
who O
specializes O
in O
reproductive O
- O
related O
med O

) O
. O


> O
I O
starter O
taking O
it O
on O
Friday O
and O
by O
Saturday O
  O
felt O
extremely O
lethargic B-ADR
and O
just O
drained B-ADR
. O

It O
was O
like O
waking O
up O
from O
taking O
benadryl B-DRUG
( O
which O
makes O
me O
feel O
off O
for O
like O
2 O
days O
) O
. O

I O
felt O
excessively O
tired B-ADR
, O
could O
n't O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
, O
and O
suddenly O
felt O
very O
depressed B-ADR
. O

It O
all O
just O
hit O
me O
out O
of O
nowhere O
. O



 O
Take O
a O
smaller O
dose O
- O
I O
took O
5 O
mg O
propanolol B-DRUG
and O
I O
was O
ok O
. O

But O
10 O
mg O
makes O
me O
very O
dizzy B-ADR
and O
lightheaded B-ADR
, O
almost O
like O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
pass B-ADR
out I-ADR
. O


I O
was O
told O
that O
hydroxychloroquine B-DRUG
/ O
planequil B-DRUG
is O
almost O
always O
the O
first O
line O
treatment O
unless O
there O
's O
organ O

 O
It O
's O

kind O

working O
for O
me O

It O
has O
a O
six O

period O
and O
I O
'm O
on O
month O
four O

a O
half O

I O
have O
" O
flares B-ADR
" O
but O
the O
pain B-ADR
is O
n't O
constant O
like O
it O
was O
before O
I O
started O
it O
. O



 O
They O
may O
pick O
something O
more O
aggressive O
if O
your O
symptoms O
are O
more O
aggressive O
though O
. O

I O
do O
n't O

any O

just O
inflammatory B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
and O
lab O
results O
. O



 O
They O
also O
gave O
me O
a O
short O
course O
of O
prednisone B-DRUG
right O
at O
the O
start O
because O
I O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
inflammation B-ADR
. O



 O
I O
would O
n't O
worry O
about O
situations O
where O
people O
are O
on O
a O
ton O
of O
different O

maybe O
get O

because O
the O
disease O
varies O
so O
much O
and O
you O
do O

that O
you O
will O
ever O

I O
did O

realize O
for O
a O

was O
that O
anger B-ADR

 O
Once O
I O

the O

my O

I O
was O

it O

  O
This O
is O
why O
every O
MS O
medication O
will O
have O
a O
warning O
to O
not O
get O
pregnant O
while O
on O
it O
. O

  O
That O
warning O
is O
n’t O
necessary O
due O
to O
proof O
the O
medication O
will O
harm O
a O
fetus O
, O
rather O
it O
’s O
due O
to O
a O
* O
lack O
of O
proof O
* O
that O
it O
wo O
n’t O
cause O
harm O
. O



 O
What O
can O
be O
done O
: O
retrospective O
studies O
reviewing O
cases O
where O
women O
on O
those O
DMTs O
happen O
to O
get O
pregnant O
; O
reviewing O
those O
pregnancies O
to O
see O
if O
there O
are O
any O
signals O
of O
harmful O
impact O
. O

  O
This O
is O
why O
the O
oldest O
DMT O
’s O
are O
currently O
the O
only O
ones O
widely O
used O
in O
pregnancy O
- O
they O
’ve O
been O
out O
long O
enough O
, O
and O
there O
has O
been O
enough O
observational O
data O
collected O
with O
no O
harmful O
signals O
that O
they O
are O
generally O
accepted O
as O
‘ O
safe O
in O
pregnancy O
’ O
. O

 

 O
We O
all O
know O
that O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
is O
n’t O
perfect O
and O
pregnancies O
will O
happen O
on O
every O
DMT O
at O
some O
point O
. O

  O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
has O
been O
out O
long O
enough O
now O
that O
there O
have O
been O
many O
pregnancies O
while O
on O
it O
, O
and O
so O
far O
, O
no O
harmful O
signals O
have O
been O
seen O
that O
would O
indicate O
it O
is O
detrimental O
, O
thus O
many O
medical O
providers O
are O
feeling O
more O
comfortable O
with O
their O
patients O
getting O
pregnant O
while O
on O
them O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
them O
still O
err O
on O
the O
side O
of O
caution O
, O
recommending O
getting O
your O
infusion O
, O
then O
waiting O
til O
month O
5 O
or O
6 O
to O
get O
pregnant O
, O
and O
if O
you O
get O
pregnant O
in O
that O
time O
, O
wait O
for O
your O
next O
dose O
til O
after O
pregnancy O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n’t O
, O
then O
proceed O
with O
next O
infusion O
, O
wait O
several O
months O
, O
and O
try O
again O
. O

 

 O
It O
comes O
down O
to O
trying O
to O
balance O
the O
risk O
of O
further O
progression O
( O
ensuring O
you O
are O
around O
and O
able O
to O
participate O
in O
your O
child O
’s O
life O
for O
the O
long O
term O
) O
with O
the O
unknowns O
around O
whether O
or O
not O
your O
DMT O
will O
cause O
harm O
to O
your O
fetus O
. O


No O
, O
both O
almost O
killed O
me O
but O
furosemide B-DRUG
has O
worked O
out O
ok O
after O
my O
stent O
. O

Before O
not O
so O
much O
either O
but O
at O
least O
it O
was O
n’t O
dangerous O
. O


Oh O
wow O
, O
I O
am O
so O
screenshotting O
this O
to O
share O
with O
my O
mom O
( O
my O
bff O
and O
personal O
care O
nurse O
since O
childhood O
) O
! O

! O

My O
first O
rheumatologist O
was O
absolutely O
atrocious O
, O
I O
literally O
can O
not O
begin O
to O
explain O
how O
awful O
she O
was O
, O
but O
the O
least O
of O
her O
transgressions O
was O
not O
telling O
me O
ANYTHING O
about O
diet O
, O
exercise O
, O
lifestyle O
changes O
, O
etc O
. O

“ O
Take O
your O
meds O
and O
I O
’ll O
see O
you O
in O
3 O
months O
for O
a O
refill O
. O

” O


 O
I O
started O
taking O
a O
turmeric O
& O
ginger O
gummy O
because O
I O
was O
literally O
just O
fumbling O
around O
in O
the O
dark O
and O
my O
grocery O
store O
does O
n’t O
sell O
fresh O
turmeric O
… O
have O
you O
personally O
tried O
lionsmane O
? O

I O
’m O
not O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
mushrooms O
, O
would O
a O
powdered O
capsule O
version O
work O
? O

I O
would O
love O
to O
get O
set O
up O
with O
a O
dietician O
or O
nutritionist O
who O
specializes O
in O
autoimmune O
/ O
inflammatory O
illnesses O
or O
something O
but O
I O
would O
n’t O
even O
know O
how O
to O
go O
about O
finding O
one O
, O
let O
alone O
one O
who O
specializes O
in O
that O
and O
is O
covered O
by O
my O
insurance O
. O

😞 O


 O
Last O
question O
, O
I O
promise O
! O

I O
was O
always O
told O
that O
if O
you O
can O
get O
away O
with O
taking O
“ O
just O
” O
an O
oral O
DMARD O
( O
like O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
leflunomide B-DRUG
, O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
, O
hydroxychloroquine B-DRUG
, O
etc O
. O

) O
without O
an O
injectable O
/ O
infusable O
biologic O
( O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
Orencia B-DRUG
, O
Simponi B-DRUG
, O
etc O
. O

) O
then O
that O
’s O
generally O
the O
preferred O
option O
since O
the O
biologics O
work O
so O
well O
for O
RA O
* O
because O
* O
they O
’re O
so O
good O
at O
weakening O
the O
immune O
system O
. O

But O
I O
’ve O
already O
struck O
out O
with O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
leflunomide B-DRUG
and O
I O
’m O
simply O
not O
patient O
enough O
to O
sit O
at O
home O
waiting O
6 O
+ O
months O
to O
see O
* O
IF O
* O
the O
hydroxychloroquine B-DRUG
works O
, O
and O
then O
if O
it O
does O
n’t O
, O
ANOTHER O
6 O
+ O
months O
testing O
the O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
before O
finally O
moving O
on O
to O
biologics O
. O

Just O
gimme O
the O
stuff O
you O
know O
works O
! O


God O
.. O
our O
D O
looks O
like O
it O
took O
some O
Prozac B-DRUG
between O
periods O
. O


Nice O
! O

I O
’m O
on O
sertraline B-DRUG
and O
have O
been O
pretty O
solid O
, O
but O
my O
psych O
put O
me O
on O
gaba O
to O
curb O
the O
drinking O
, O
so O
it O
feels O
a O
bit O
overkill O
. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
info O

Call O
your O
doc O
. O

They O
can O
prescribe O
a O
medication O
to O
take O
the O
akathesia B-ADR
away O
. O

I O
took O
propanolol B-DRUG
and O
it O
made O
the O
akathesia B-ADR
go O
away O
. O

There O
s O
other O
ones O
like O
benztropine B-DRUG
and O
cogentin B-DRUG
. O


My O
total O
was O
335 O
and O
my O

After O
3 O
months O
on O
20 O
mg O
of O
Lipitor B-DRUG
it O
has O
gone O
down O
to O
150 O

And O
, O
i O
do O
nt O
have O

they O
find O
some O
new O
strong O
products O

Prednisone B-DRUG

Heard O
that O
it O
starts O
melting O
before O
you O
put O
in O
your O
mouth O
and O
then O
gets O
stuck O
either O
on O
your O
tongue(if O
you O
're O
lucky O
) O
or O
the O
back O
of O
the O
throat O
. O


Grapefruit O
juice O
does O
n't O
affect O
Lexapro B-DRUG
do O
n't O
worry O
, O
it O
is O
only O
bad O
with O
sertraline B-DRUG
in O
the O
ssri O
class O
and O
other O
medications O
such O
as O
benzos B-DRUG
. O

I O
know O
as O
I O
have O
been O
on O
both O
, O
and O
drank O
a O
lot O
of O
grapefruit O
juice O
on O
lexapro B-DRUG
, O
whereas O
my O
sertraline B-DRUG
had O
the O
necessary O
warning O
on O
the O
bottle O
. O

You O
'll O
be O
fine O
:) O

When O
you O
start O
Allo B-DRUG
, O
as O
you O
said O
, O
it O
's O
super O
common O
to O
experience O
a O
flare B-ADR
- I-ADR
up I-ADR
. O

I O
think O
most O
people O
experience O
something O
, O
but O
there O
's O
always O
this O
worst O
case O
that O
some O
new O
to B-DRUG
Allo O
, O
it O
can O
take O
upwards O
of O
a O
year O
for O
their O
body O
to O
adjust O
, O
and O
they O
can O
experience O
flare B-ADR
- I-ADR
ups I-ADR
the O
whole O
time O
. O



 O
I O
went O
seven O
years O
without O
Allo B-DRUG
, O
but O
when O
( O
like O
you O
) O
my O
UA O
started O
to O
rise O
into O
the O
danger O
zone O
, O
my O
doctor O
was O
like O
yeah O
, O
it O
's O
time O
, O
and O
... O
I O
was O
never O
against O
it O
, O
I O
was O
just O
managing O
( O
and O
testing O
) O
fine O
without O
Allo B-DRUG
, O
so O
starting O
was O
a O
no O
brainer O
. O

Of O
course O
I O
'll O
start O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
my O
doctor O
sent O
me O
home O
with O
my O
prescription O
for O
Allopurinol B-DRUG
+ O
Colchicine B-DRUG
just O
in O
case O
. O

And O
I O
did O
end O
up O
with O
a O
minor O
flare B-ADR
( O
possibly O
minor O
due O
to O
having O
the O
Colchicine B-DRUG
on O
hand O
) O
but O
that O
was O
it O
for O
me O
. O

If O
the O
flare B-ADR
- I-ADR
up I-ADR
was O
bad O
, O
I O
'd O
have O
asked O
my O
doctor O
for O
a O
tapering O
dose O
of O
Prednisone B-DRUG
. O

In O
fact O
, O
if O
you O
feel O
you O
're O
there O
and O
that O
's O
what O
you O
need O
, O
dude O
, O
call O
your O
doctor O
and O
say O
that O
. O



 O
So O
yeah O
, O
your O
dad O
is O
wrong O
. O

It O
's O
a O
medically O
proven O
fact O
that O
this O
can O
happen O
, O
and O
I O
hear O
you O
, O
it O
's O
discouraging O
, O
but O
... O
just O
cross O
your O
fingers O
and O
hope O
that O
this O
is O
your O
last O
. O

Honestly O
, O
look O
at O
it O
this O
way O
. O

If O
you O
did O
n't O
start O
Allopurinol B-DRUG
, O
there O
'd O
likely O
be O
at O
least O
two O
more O
flare B-ADR
ups O
in O
your O
future O
. O

The O
one O
that O
was O
inevitable O
due O
to O
your O
high O
UA O
, O
and O
then O
this O
one O
due O
to O
starting O
Allo B-DRUG
. O

At O
least O
in O
this O
case O
one O
and O
done O
is O
a O
real O
possibility O
. O


My O
daughter O
failed O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
has O
been O
in O
remission O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
for O
three O
years O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
find O
something O
that O
works O
for O
you O
. O

I O
too O
am O
flailing O
, O
having O
just O
failed O
Entyvio B-DRUG

it O
’s O
affecting O
my O
mental O

that O
I O
’ve O
been O
approved O

no O

need O
a O

complete O

send O

he O
’d O

but O
it O
’s O
worth O
asking O
about O
. O


It O
has O
flat O
out O
saved O
my O
  O
skin O

my O

I O
could O

the O

This O
is O
exactly O
me O

OP O
, O
it O
's O
so O
common O
and O
nothing O
to O
be O
embarrassed O
about O
, O
but O
I O
totally O
understand O
why O
you O
feel O
that O
way O
. O

I O
felt O
ashamed O
to O
say O
what O
I O
was O
feeling O
out O
loud O
to O
my O
psychiatrist O
. O

It O
's O
scary O
and O
it O
's O
hard O
. O

But O
yes O
, O
my O
PPD B-ADR
hit O
around O
the O
4 O
month O
regression B-ADR
too O
. O

I O
finally O
started O
Zoloft B-DRUG

only O
sleeping O
45min-1hr O

I O
feel O
better O
and O
she O
is O
now O
also O
sleeping O
better O
😅 O

I O
just O
said O
what O
you O
said O
in O
this O
post O
to O
my O
pcp O
. O

   O
This O
was O
after O
a O
nearly O
20 O
pound O
gain O
when O
my O
weight O
had O
been O
stable O
for O
years O
( O
up O
and O
down O
the O
same O
10 O
pounds O
) O
. O

   O
I O
told O
her O
I O
was O
tired O
and O
that O
I O
had O
tried O
weight O
watchers O
, O
lose O
it O
, O
working O
with O
my O
therapist O
etc O
. O

   O
I O
had O
surgery O
2 O
years O
ago O
for O
fibroids B-ADR
and O
I O
was O
tired O
and O
needed O
help O
. O

   O
She O
ordered O
blood O
work O
and O
prescribed O
wegovy B-DRUG
( O
which O
insurance O
did O
nt O
cover O
) O
  O
she O
eventually O
proscribed O
ozempic B-DRUG
. O

   O
We O
talked O
about O
my O
a1c O
which O
was O
borderline O
prediabetic O
, O
high O
blood O
pressure O
and O
everything O
else O
. O

   O
With O
the O
pressure O
i O
m O
not O
a O
good O
candidate O
for O
the O
stimulants O
. O

  O
So O
she O
was O
willing O
to O
try O
. O

   O
My O
Dr. O
Knew O
that O
wegovy B-DRUG
and O
ozempic B-DRUG
were O
the O
same O
. O

   O
She O
prescribed O
metformin B-DRUG
and O
ozempic B-DRUG
at O
the O
same O
time O
to O
cover O
my O
insurance O
requirements O
for O
step O
therapy O
and O
i O
'm O
now O
up O
to O
the O
0.5 O
dose O
and O
10 O
pounds O
down O
! O

   O
Have O
the O
convo O
and O
I O
suggest O
you O
research O
ahead O
of O
time O
what O
your O
insurance O
will O
cover O
to O
avoid O
headaches O
. O

Bottom O
line O
, O
I O
told O
her O
I O
was O
tired O
and O
was O
not O
interested O
in O
being O
told O
to O
just O
diet O
and O
exercise O
i O
've O
been O
doing O
that O
for O
years O
and O
it O
has O
n't O
worked O
I O
need O
help O
. O

( O
Sorry O
I O
know O
its O
a O
long O
post O
but O
, O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
share O
my O
whole O
process O
) O

If O
you O
want O
to O
try O
medication O
and O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
hunt O
for O
a O
therapist O
you O
can O
use O
telemedicine O
apps O
pretty O
easily O
. O

I O
use O
plushcare O
and O
you O
can O
go O
from O
" O
signed O
up O
" O
to O
" O
doctor O
" O
in O
like O
30 O
minutes O
. O

It O
is O
pretty O
cheap O
I O
think O
even O
without O
insurance O
. O



 O
Something O
along O
the O
lines O
of O
" O
I O
recently O
learned O
I O
have O
OCD B-ADR

have O
heard O
prozac B-DRUG
could O
help O
with O
this O
condition O
. O

Could O
we O
try O
me O
on O
20 O
mg O
to O
start O
? O

" O
. O

They O
will O
only O
prescribe O
1 O
month O
without O
a O
follow O
up O
but O
its O
super O
convenient O
and O
much O
cheaper O
than O
a O
normal O

Hello O
! O

I O
am O
a O
27yo O
female O
so O
we O
are O
close O
in O
age O
:) O

I O
am O
still O
in O
search O
of O
a O
primary O
care O
doctor O
and O
rheumatologist O
that O
is O
interested O
in O
helping O
me O
identify O
triggers O
, O
but O
so O
far O
they O
are O
only O
interested O
in O
prescribing O
medication O
to O
control O
this O
disease O
. O


My O
friend O
has O
lupus B-ADR
and O
gets O
fatigue B-ADR
easily O
, O
I O
wonder O
if O
you O
have O
a O
different O
autoimmune O
before O
it O
changed O
to O
RA O
? O


I O
do O
n’t O
know O
if O
I O
should O
call O
my O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
flares B-ADR
. O

They O
consistently O
develop O
overnight O
when O
I O
exerted O
my O
joints O
too O
much O
or O
ate O
sugar O
, O
high O
carbs O
, O
consumed O
alcohol O
. O

I O
personally O
think O
my O
RA O
is O
very O
much O
related O
to O
diet O
and O
digestion O
. O

The O
pain B-ADR
last O
the O
whole O
day O
if O
I O
do O
n’t O
take O
Advil B-DRUG
. O


With O
humira B-DRUG
, O
diet O
control O
, O
and O
the O
occasional O
Advil B-DRUG
, O
I O
started O
running O
again O
. O

My O
friend O
eased O
me O
into O
some O
easier O
yoga O
poses O
. O


Lots O
of O
hugs O
and O
best O
of O
luck O
to O
you O
! O


Any O
side O
effects O
from O
humira B-DRUG
? O


Favorite O
is O
stelara B-DRUG
( O
ustekinumab B-DRUG
) O
for O
now O
. O

I O
have O
liked O
humira B-DRUG
( O
adalimumab B-DRUG
) O
and O
remicade B-DRUG
( O
infliximab B-DRUG
) O
in O
the O
past O
. O



 O
If O
your O
least O
favorite O
drug O
is O
n't O
Prednisone B-DRUG
you O
're O
in O
the O
wrong O
sub O

Yup O
, O
for O
blood O
/ O
lasix B-DRUG
I O
'd O
always O
try O
to O
get O
the O
hourly O
done O
so O
that O
they O
were O
n't O
thrown O
into O
a O
whirlwind O
when O
they O
got O
to O
the O
floor O

Yep O
I O
feel O
that O
. O

Hahah O
I O
'm O
sorry O
the O
propanolol B-DRUG
did O
nt O
work O
I O
'm O
hoping O
it O
ll O
work O
for O
me O
but O
we O
'll O
see O

Oh O
dang O
. O

I O
got O
bursitis B-ADR
in O
my O
hip O
recently O
. O

It O
’s O
no O
joke O
! O

At O
its O
worst O
, O
there O
were O
moments O
where O
I O
physically O
could O
n’t O
walk O
. O

I O
’m O
only O
in O
my O
early O
30 O
’s O
! O

I O
was O
taking O
4 O
Ibuprofen B-DRUG
, O
a O
muscle O
relaxer O
, O
and O
some O
prednisone B-DRUG
just O
to O
function O
. O


I O
had O
a O
similar O
experience O
, O
although O
in O
my O
case O
, O
when O
I O
met O
with O
the O
Dr O
to O
tell O
them O
I O
wanted O
a O
vasectomy O
I O
said O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
a O
valium B-DRUG
. O

Cue O
a O
month O
( O
+ O
or O
- O
) O
later O
I O
asked O
for O
a O
valium B-DRUG
and O
had O
roughly O
the O
same O
experience O
as O
you O
did O
. O



 O
That O
said O
, O
I O
ended O
up O
having O
several O
numbing O
shots O
because O
the O
Dr O
had O
a O
problem O
locating O
one O
of O
my O
chords O
- O
it O
took O
him O
like O
40 O
minutes O
. O



 O
& O
# O
x200B O
; O


 O
It O
's O
been O
almost O
a O
year O
, O
I O
'm O
go O
to O
go O
. O

Second O
best O
surgery O
I O
've O
had O
( O
first O
was O
Lasix B-DRUG
) O
. O


Did O
she O
lay O
out O
a O
plan O
for O
you O
? O

And O
does O
she O
have O
experience O
with O
PMDD B-ADR
? O

You O
can O
always O
check O
[ O
IAPMD O
's O
list O
of O
providers](https://iapmd.org O

to O
see O
if O
anyone O
with O
PMDD B-ADR
experience O
is O
near O
you O
. O

But O
if O
she O
takes O
you O
seriously O
and O
is O
willing O
to O
work O
with O
you O
, O
that O
's O
also O
great O
. O



 O
There O
are O
several O
things O
that O
could O
be O
checked O
. O

Thyroid B-ADR
issues I-ADR
or O
adrenal B-ADR
gland I-ADR
issues I-ADR
have O
some O
overlap O
with O
PMDD B-ADR
symptoms O
. O



 O
Depression B-ADR
tends O
to O
get O
worse O
when O
one O
is O
iron O
deficient O
and/or O
anemic B-ADR
. O

Has O
that O
been O
ruled O
out O
yet O
? O



 O
You O
could O
try O
hormonal O
BC O
, O
if O
you O
have O
n't O
already O
done O
that O
. O



 O
There O
's O
the O
possibility O
to O
up O
your O
Prozac B-DRUG
dose O
during O
luteal O
phase O
. O



 O
B O
vitamins O
, O
especially O
B6 O
seem O
to O
help O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
as O
well O
. O



 O
Genetic O
screening O
could O
in O
theory O
show O
up O
some O
things O
that O
might O
help O
or O
that O
you O
might O
want O
to O
avoid O
. O

There O
are O
some O
people O
who O
get O
worse O
on O
things O
that O
help O
others O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
what O
your O
budget O
for O
testing O
that O
may O
or O
may O
not O
end O
up O
helping O
is O
. O

A O
23andme O
is O
fairly O
cheap O
and O
I O
think O
it O
can O
show O
you O
if O
you O
have O
slow O
COMT O
or O
a O
variant O
that O
interferes O
with O
methylation O
. O



 O
If O
something O
is O
off O
about O
your O
body O
's O
methylation O
ability O
, O
then O
e.g. O
SAM O
- O
e O
might O
help O
. O

It O
's O
been O
reported O
to O
help O
with O
PMS B-ADR
/ O
PMDD B-ADR
symptoms O
. O



 O
It O
would O
be O
super O
helpful O
to O
know O
if O
you O
've O
gotten O
any O
kind O
of O
testing O
done O
. O


It O
seemed O
like O
the O
Prednisone B-DRUG
helped O
at O
first O
but O
I O
've O
kind O
of O
plateaued O
and O
gotten O
to O
a O
point O
where O
I O
wake O
up O
each O
morning O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
any O
better O
, O
if O
anything O
worse O
. O

It O
's O
still O
early O
on O
in O
the O
process O
of O
my O
diagnosis O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
change O
anything O
because O
maybe O
it O
will O
work O
, O
and O
I O
'll O
still O
be O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
calendar O
year O
so O
I O
'm O
hoping O
that O
'll O
help O
. O

Just O
a O
little O
frustrated O
that O
the O
timelines O
are O
n't O
working O
out O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
commit O
to O
going O
to O
school O
somewhere O
and O
then O
pulling O
out O
last O
minute O
because O
of O
still O
dealing O
with O
this O
pain B-ADR
. O

Thanks O
, O
and O
yeah O
I O
know O
I O
've O
got O
to O
be O
more O
patient O

I O
understand O
the O
frustration O
. O

Do O
n't O
give O
up O
trying O
to O
solve O
it O
. O

I O
never O
tried O
ivabradine B-DRUG
. O

Tbh O
my O
adrenaline B-ADR
rushes I-ADR
got O
waaay O
better O
once O
I O
prioritized O
getting O
decent O
sleep O
. O

Before O
I O
started O
taking O
the O
propanolol B-DRUG
and O
midodrine B-DRUG
before O
bed O
, O
I O
literally O
could O
not O
stay O
asleep O
for O
more O
than O
3 O
hrs O
and O
it O
was O
still O
terrible O
quality O
of O
sleep O
. O

It O
was O
a O
vicious O
cycle O
of O
never O
being O
able O
to O
heal O
or O
recover O
. O

I O
made O
getting O
better O
sleep O
my O
top O
priority O
and O
I O
saw O
a O
massive O
improvement O
in O
all O
my O
other O
symptoms O
. O

My O
adrenaline O
rushes O
would O
also O
happen O
when O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
sleep O
so O
the O
beta O
blocker O
and O
midodrine B-DRUG
seemed O
to O
help O
this O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
we O
had O
the O
same O
caliber O
of O
adrenaline O
dumps O
but O
I O
recommend O
taking O
my O
case O
and O
others O
you O
read O
about O
and O
talking O
about O
then O
with O
your O
doctor O
to O
get O
their O
take O
on O
it O
. O

They O
might O
be O
able O
to O
offer O
some O
helpful O
recommendations O
. O


I O
went O
from O
lorazepam B-DRUG
to O
prozac B-DRUG
and O
I O
can O
only O
say O
good O
things O
. O

I O
take O
alprazolam B-DRUG
every O
few O
weeks O
or O
even O
months O
in O
a O
small O
dose O
for O
anything O
majorly O
anxiety B-ADR
provoking O
( O
which O
would O
cause O
a O
panic B-ADR
attack I-ADR
) O
but O
the O
overthinking O
/ O
general O
anxiety B-ADR
completely O
vanished O
with O
prozac B-DRUG
. O


For O
me O
Zoloft B-DRUG
did O
n’t O
give O
me O
a O
feeling O
of O
happiness O
, O
it O
was O
more O
like O
feeling O
“ O
normal O
” O
, O
a O
little O
numb B-ADR
even O
. O

No O
more O
high O
highs O
and O
low O
lows O
. O

It O
made O
feelings O
anxiety B-ADR
and O
depression B-ADR
more O
proportional O
and O
manageable O
. O

Made O
me O
a O
lot O
more O
functional O
. O

Still O
get O
anxious B-ADR
or O
sad B-ADR
like O
we O
all O
do O
sometimes O
but O
those O
feelings O
are O
no O
longer O
paralyzing O
. O


I O
do O
n’t O
know O
about O
Spiro B-DRUG
or O
metformin B-DRUG
. O

But O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
, O
from O
my O
understanding O
, O
will O
affect O
cortisol O
levels O
and O
will O
mess O
up O
test O
results O
. O



 O
If O
you O
look O
up O
the O
website O
Good O
Hormone O
Health O
, O
there O
’s O
a O
page O
on O
there O
about O
what O
medications O
affect O
testing O
. O



 O
My O
endocrinologist O
told O
me O
not O
to O
take O
anything O
for O
at O
least O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
before O
testing O
. O

No O
pain O
killers O
, O
no O
Valium B-DRUG
, O
no O
frusemide B-DRUG
( O
for O
edema B-ADR
) O
, O
no O
alcohol O
. O

  O
And O
she O
will O
not O
prescribe O
ozempic B-DRUG
until O
after O
testing O
. O



 O
Also O
, O
be O
aware O
that O
any O
vitamin O
supplements O
containing O
biotin O
will O
affect O
testing O
also O
. O



 O
Hope O
that O
helps O
. O


First O
thing O
, O
amazing O
on O
you O
for O
educating O
yourself O
on O
this O
. O

You O
're O
an O
amazing O
partner O
. O



 O
Metformin B-DRUG
does O
little O
to O
nothing O
except O
give O
side O
effects O
in O
type O
1/1.5 O
/ O
LADA O
. O

It O
's O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
get O
off O
it O
. O

Insulin O
is O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
to O
be O
taking O
. O



 O
CGM O
all O
the O
way O
, O
he O
's O
young O
so O
it O
might O
just O
be O
a O
lot O
to O
process O
right O
now O
. O

But O
the O
earlier O
he O
gets O
it O
the O
more O
in O
control O
he O
might O
feel O
. O

After O
a O
few O
insertions O
you O
do O
n't O
feel O
it O
at O
all O
anymore O
. O

It O
's O
the O
only O
way O
you O
stop O
getting O
surprised O
when O
you O
do O
a O
finger O
stick O
. O



 O
Also O
suggest O
pump O
, O
Omnipod O
is O
my O
choice O
. O

Control O
is O
incredible O
with O
it O
and O
you O
can O
microdise O
insulin O
below O
1 O
unit O
, O
important O
for O
honeymoon O
phase O
. O

I O
hate O
needles O
so O
I O
would O
n't O
do O
MDI O
unless O
I O
had O
to O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
feel O
it O
when O
it O
's O
on O
you O
. O

Another O
option O
is O
inhaled O
insulin O
, O
but O
it O
's O
strong O
and O
mount O
be O
too O
much O
of O
he O
's O
recently O
been O
diagnosed O
. O



 O
ED B-ADR
is O
a O
pretty O
serious O
complication O
( O
in O
my O
mind O
) O
, O
it O
made O
me O
worry O
if O
he O
's O
starting O
to O
get O
irreversible O
damage O
. O

Is O
he O
concerned O
about O
it O
at O
much O
as O
you O
are O
? O



 O
I O
sense O
you O
're O
a O
bit O
frantic O
right O
now O
with O
the O
length O
of O
your O
post O
. O

Diabetes O
also O
affects O
your O
mental O
health O
as O
the O
carer O
( O
since O
his O
parents O
seem O
like O
real O
pieces O
of O
work O
about O
it O
, O
you O
're O
taking O
up O
the O
slack O
) O
. O

Remember O
to O
take O
a O
break O
from O
it O
for O
you O
. O

Your O
BF O
has O
to O
want O
these O
things O
too O
, O
from O
your O
text O
he O
seems O
to O
kinda O
be O
going O
along O
with O
things O
. O

Sadly O
he O
has O
to O
also O
advocate O
and O
take O
charge O
of O
this O
as O
well O
. O

You O
can O
learn O
all O
you O
want O
but O
if O
he O
wo O
n't O
push O
as O
well O
it O
wo O
n't O
matter O
much O
. O


What O
’s O
the O
big O
deal O
with O
statins O
? O

I O
take O
an O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
every O
morning O
, O
and O
my O
numbers O
are O
fine O
. O

Easy O
peasy O

It O
is O
not O
horrible O
  O
bad O
, O
but O
imho O
going O
on O
Telmisartan B-DRUG
is O
a O
good O
idea O
- O
considering O
that O
you O
already O
are O
doing O
everything O
besides O
drugs O
to O
lower O
it O
. O




 O
Just O
40 O
mg O
Telmisartan B-DRUG
should O
do O
the O
trick O
. O

Or O
just O
5 O
mg O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
. O


I O
had O
this O
and O
the O
best O
thing O
I O
did O
for O
it O
was O
propanolol- B-DRUG
a O
beta O
blocker O
. O

I O
was O
finally O
able O
to O
sleep O

My O
neurologist O
does O
MRI O
yearly O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
for O
2 O
years O
and O
everything O
is O
pretty O
stable O
. O

How O
long O
have O
you O
been O
on O
DMT O
? O

Which O
DMT O
are O
you O
on O
? O


Yeah O
that O
sucks O
because O
propanolol B-DRUG
is O
a O
non O
- O
selective O
beta O
blocker O
and O
although O
the O
hydrochlorothiazide B-DRUG
in O
the O
lisinopril B-DRUG
hctz B-DRUG
decreases B-ADR
the I-ADR
serum I-ADR
potassium I-ADR
it O
basically O
canceled O
out O
by O
the O
lisinopril B-DRUG
. O



 O
And O
with O
POTS O
you O
really O
need O
the O
extra O
salt O
to O
help O
with O
blood O
pressure O
. O

But O
the O
higher O
your O
potassium O
goes O
the O
lower O
your O
BP O
goes O
. O



 O
Hopefully O
your O
appointment O
goes O
well O
and O
they O
can O
give O
you O
some O
direction O
or O
refer O
you O
to O
a O
good O
nutritionist O
or O
something O
. O


I O
’m O
so O
sorry O
for O
you O
:( O

I O
’m O
about O
to O
try O
for O
a O
baby O
myself O
in O
a O
few O
months O
, O
just O
giving O
myself O
extra O
time O
to O
workout O
and O
lose B-ADR
weight I-ADR
before O
that O
. O


It O
absolutely O
KILLS O
me O
to O
read O
on O
r O
/ O
PCOS O
feedbacks O
of O
people O
struggling O
to O
obtain O
information O
and O
solutions O
when O
discussing O
with O
their O
doctors O
. O


I O
have O
been O
there O
too O
. O

I O
am O
now O
28 O
and O
was O
diagnosed O
at O
18 O
. O

Between O
16 O
and O
20 O
, O
the O
two O
solutions O
that O
were O
given O
to O
me O
were O
: O
workout O
and O
take O
the O
pill O
. O

I O
did O
workout O
, O
I O
did O
lift O
weights O
. O

When O
I O
met O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
I O
was O
given O
a O
new O
pill O
that O
literally O
destroyed O
me O
in O
less O
than O
a O
year O
. O

My O
health O
now O
relies O
entirely O
on O
Metformin B-DRUG
and O
Myo B-DRUG
- I-DRUG
Insositol I-DRUG
. O



 O
I O
’m O
sorry O
, O
I O
’m O
re O
- O
reading O
your O
post O
and O
realize O
that O
I O
’m O
not O
bringing O
any O
solution O
regarding O
conception O
. O


Sending O
you O
lots O
of O
support O
, O
hang O
in O
there O
(: O

They O
might O
just O
want O
you O
start O
the O
prednisone B-DRUG
again O
. O

It O
's O
really O
something O
to O
power O
through O
, O
I O
think O
most O
people O
do O
n't O
tolerate O
it O
all O
that O
well O
. O

Unless O
you O
mean O
you O
had O
a O
severe O
reaction B-ADR
. O

Good O
luck O
with O
the O
appt O
. O


Of O
course O
they O
save O
money O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
cover O
anything O
expensive O
over O
cheaper O
alternatives O
without O
prior O
authorization O
. O

And O
it O
is O
getting O
a O
little O
extreme O
when O
rosuvastatin B-DRUG
is O
n't O
covered O
but O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
is O
. O


I O
do O
! O

I O
had O
" O
crohns O
related O
inflammatory B-ADR
arhtritis I-ADR
" O
in O
my O
back O
and O
hips O
, O
and O
because O
of O
that O
they O
decided O
to O
move O
me O
from O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
straight O
to O
humira B-DRUG
. O

Joints O
started O
to O
feel O
better O
in O
2 O
- O
3 O
weeks O
, O
and O
my O
GI B-ADR
issues I-ADR
started O
to O
resolve O
around O
month O
5 O
. O


I O
would O
probably O
take O
some O
Zoloft B-DRUG
and O
job O
hop O
until O
you O
find O
something O
that O
is O
n't O
horrible O
. O

And O
do O
n't O
drink O
or O
smoke O
weed O
or O
do O
drugs O
because O
they O
really O
do O
n't O
help O
anything O
. O


How O
do O
they O
get O
stored O
in O
the O
same O
place O
though O
? O

One O
is O
furosemide B-DRUG
and O
o O
e O
is O
noradrenaline O
. O



 O
Like O
here O
in O
Aus O
we O
store O
Olanzapine B-DRUG
out O
of O
alphabetical O
order O
to O
stop O
twits O
picking O
it O
up O
instead O
of O
ondansetron B-DRUG
. O

I O
mean O
both O
will O
work O
on O
nausea B-ADR
but O
ya O
know O
. O



 O
I O
do O
nt O
really O
understand O
the O
american O
system O
of O
nursing O
. O

You O
all O
seem O
like O
wonderful O
nurses O
but O
the O
system O
really O
appears O
built O
against O
you O
. O


Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
advice O
! O

It O
was O
my O
first O
month O
my O
fiance O
and O
I O
really O
started O
trying O
( O
we O
have O
had O
unprotected O
sex O
in O
the O
past O
but O
first O
time O
really O
trying O
and O
First O
month O
on O
metformin B-DRUG
) O
so O
it O
’s O
kind O
of O
crazy O
and O
not O
really O
too O
expected O
. O

I O
tested O
three O
times O
to O
be O
safe O
! O

Will O
do O
! O

And O
I O
’ll O
make O
sure O
to O
keep O
our O
sub O
updated O
on O
the O
journey O
. O


I O
've O
never O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
PCOS O
, O
but O
they O
kinda O
treat O
me O
like O
I O
have O
it O
? O

If O
that O
makes O
sense O
. O




 O
My O
first O
cycle O
was O
also O
cancelled O
due O
to O
poor O
response O
I O
had O
3 O
mature O
sized O
follicles O
after O
14 O
days O
of O
stims O
. O

After O
a O
blood O
test O
we O
found O
out O
that O
I O
had O
insulin B-ADR
resistance I-ADR
so O
my O
body O
was O
n't O
taking O
in O
the O
injections O
like O
it O
should O
have O
. O

Maybe O
ask O
your O
doctor O
if O
that O
could O
be O
a O
factor O
? O

They O
put O
me O

Thank O

My O
vet O
found O
she O
had O
a O
heart B-ADR
murmur I-ADR
about O
6 O
years O
ago O
. O

Last O
year O
they O
said O
it O
was O
louder O
but O
she O
was O
doing O
great O
. O

They O
warned O
me O
about O
coughing B-ADR
and O
I O
took O
her O
right O
in O
when O
the O
coughing B-ADR
started O
. O

Her O
heart O
is O
huge O
and O
smooshing O
her O
organs O
. O

There O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
fluid O
. O

The O
vet O
made O
me O
feel O
she O
was O
going O
to O
fall B-ADR
over O
dead O
that O
minute O
! O

She O
is O
on O
lasix B-DRUG
, O
a O
bp O
med O
, O
and O
vetmedin O
. O

She O
bounced O
back B-ADR
, O
but O
I O
noticed O
this O
week O
she O
is O
slowing O
down O
. O



 O
Vet O
appointment O
on O
Thursday O
so O
I O
will O
see O
. O

We O
have O
been O
spoiling O
her O
and O
doing O
lots O
of O
car O
rides O
. O

It O
is O
crazy O
how O
much O
we O
can O
love O
an O
animal O
! O


I O
'm O
on O
a O
few O
of O
the O
blood O
pressure O
meds O
here O
, O
and O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
and O
Amolodipine B-DRUG
are O
free O
at O
my O
local O
grocers O
pharmacy O
. O


I O
get O
heart O
palpitations B-ADR
as O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
some O
of O
my O
medications O
. O

The O
racing O
and O
thumping O
really O
sucks O
. O

My O
psychiatrist O
actually O
gave O
me O
a O
beta O
blocker O
, O
propanolol B-DRUG
, O
when O
we O
linked O
my O
insomnia B-ADR
to O
my O
racing B-ADR
heart I-ADR
. O

It O
really O
helps O
. O

Maybe O
try O
to O
get O
into O
your O
primary O
care O
and O
see O
if O
you O
can O
get O
something O
similar O
. O

It O
's O
super O
safe O
medication O
, O
even O
pregnant O
women O
can O
take O
it O
. O


I O
have O
tried O
a O
few O
different O
biologics O
and O
non O
- O
biologic O
and O
Stelara B-DRUG
is O
working O
best O
for O
me O
. O

I O
am O
on O
Prednisone B-DRUG
full O
time O
too O
as O
I O
have O
other O
autoimmune B-ADR
diseases I-ADR
and O
can O
not O
take O
immuno O
supressents O
. O


I O
take O
it O
every O
3 O
months O
and O
find O
it O
great O
so O
far O
. O



 O
My O
specialist O
said O
it O
is O
the O
one O
which O
gives O
the O
least O
side O
effects O

Not O
for O
Rx O
like O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
, O

as O
I O
got O
her O
cathed O
, O
about O
1000ml O
returned O
of O
tea O
colored O
urine O
and O
it O
was O
forcefully O
draining O
. O

Poor O
thing O
was O
trying O
to O
hold O
it O
. O

Filled O
the O
bag O
and O
kept O
going O
as O
I O
drained O
it O
into O
a O
bucket O
. O

When O
the O
CNA O
and O
I O
tried O
to O
clean O
her O
and O
turn O
her O
she O
was O
screaming O
in O
pain B-ADR
so O
, O
YA O
THINK O
he O
was O
taking O
her O
morphine B-DRUG
? O

? O

? O



 O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
left O
I O
called O
our O
NP O
and O
said O
" O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
call O
APS O
, O
I O
will O
" O
. O

She O
ended O
up O
getting O
transferred O
that O
very O
day O
and O
died O
a O
few O
DAYS O
later O
. O

Smfh O
she O
had O
been O
talking O
up O
til O
that O
week O
. O


Hi O
there O
! O

Congratulations O
on O
finally O
getting O
the O
prescription O
. O

I O
only O
had O
to O
wait O
2 O
years O
but O
it O
felt O
like O
a O
lifetime O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
mess O
- O
up O
meaning O
I O
went O
in O
to O
the O
hospital O
thinking O
" O
today O
is O
the O
day O
" O
and O
they O
had O
lost O
my O
BASDAI O
form O
so O
I O
had O
to O
do O
another O
and O
wait O
3 O
more O
months O
, O
it O
was O
heartbreaking O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
fairly O
normal O
to O
have O
some O
delay O
unfortunately O
, O
but O
I O
would O
say O
ring O
your O
hospital O
and O
tell O
them O
you O
have O
n't O
heard O
. O

If O
it O
's O
anything O
like O
how O
mine O
was O
organised O
, O
the O
hospital O
organise O
the O
prescription O
for O
you O
even O
if O
its O
delivered O
by O
an O
external O
supplier O
. O

So O
pester O
them O
! O

It O
's O
not O
worth O
waiting O
in O
pain B-ADR
, O
and O
they O
may O
have O
just O
ended O
up O
with O
someone O
else O
's O
piece O
of O
paper O
sitting O
on O
top O
of O
yours O
. O

I O
am O
also O
in O
the O
UK O
and O
got O
Humira B-DRUG
through O
the O
NHS O
in O
2015 O
. O

Wishing O
you O
the O
best O
of O
luck O
and O
feel O
free O
to O
contact O
if O
you O
have O
any O
other O
questions O
, O
I O
've O
plenty O
of O
experience O
to O
share O
! O


Not O
quite O
the O
same O
as O
your O
situation O
, O
but O
lexapro B-DRUG
helped O
a O
lot O
for O
about O
6 O
months O
( O
MDD B-DRUG
& O
GAD B-ADR
) O
. O

Then O
it O
randomly O
stopped B-ADR
helping I-ADR
and O
my O
symptoms B-ADR
returned I-ADR
. O

Doctor O
put O
me O
on O
zoloft B-DRUG
instead O
and O
it O
's O
been O
consistently O
working O
for O
the O
last O
3 O
years O
. O


Metformin B-DRUG
is O
for O
Type O
II O
insulin O
resistant O
diabetes O
. O

People O
with O
type O

have O
a O
non O
- O
working O
pancreas O
and O
can O
not O
make O
their O
own O
insulin O
so O
they O
require O
insulin O
to O
survive O
and O
to O
keep O
their O
sugar O
levels O
in O
check O
. O


I O
had O
zero O
success O
with O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
. O

After O
about O
a O
week O
and O
a O
half O
I O
had O
my O
follow O
up O
with O
my O
primary O
care O
doc O
because O
I O
was O
getting O
the O
dreaded O
nitric B-DRUG
oxide I-DRUG
tickle B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
throat I-ADR
/ O
coughing B-ADR
, O
and O
he O
switched O
me O
to O
Losartan B-DRUG
. O

4 O
weeks O
now O
and O
no O
cough B-ADR
and O
my O
levels O
have O
gone O
down O
30 O
points O
systolic O
and O
15 O
points O
diastolic O

Call O
your O

tomorrow O

Not O

And O
yet O
, O
when O

everyone O
still O
knows O
what O
you O

: O
( O

maybe O
she O
just O
takes O
it O

it O
's O
a O
total O

Anecdotally O

a O

This O

another O

is O
maybe O
just O
generally O
depleted O

 O
There O
's O
quite O
a O

this O

definitely O

) O
. O


It O
's O
interesting O
that O
in O
your O
country O
the O
electrolytes O
( O
what O
we O
would O
call O
CMP O

does O
not O

 O
You O

 O
Would O
be O
interesting O
to O
know O
what O
your O

 O
When O
you O
say O
medication O
, O
I O
assume O
a O
statin O
? O



 O
Some O
doctors O
would O
say O
you O
are O
too O
young O
for O
a O
statin O
. O

It O
's O
debatable O

 O
Metformin B-DRUG
, O
if O
you O
do O
have O
metabolic O

, O
also O
lowers B-ADR

I O
did O
n’t O
pass O
the O
1 O
- O
hr O
with O
212 O

Automatically O
diagnosed O
. O

I O
’ve O
managed O
it O
with O
diet O
for O
the O
most O
part O
but O
my O
fasting O
numbers O
were O
the O
hardest O
to O
control O
. O

I O
got O
on O
low O
dose O
metformin B-DRUG
, O
not O
insulin O
. O

I O
read O
here O
about O
someone O
being O
happy O
to O
be O
on O
it O
. O

100 O
% O
agree O
- O
a O
lot O
less O
stress O
about O
night O
time O
snacks O
, O
sleeping O
hours O
, O
etc O
. O

I O
’ve O
found O
the O
diet O
pretty O
easy O
overall O
. O

I O
eat O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
that O
I O
would O
n’t O
eat O
before O
( O
like O
peanut O
butter O
) O
and O
it O
does O
n’t O
matter O
much O
cause O
I O
cut O
out O
sugar O
. O

When O
I O
do O
eat O
sugar O
, O
I O
can O
eat O
“ O
no O
sugar O
added O
” O
things O
pretty O
easily O
( O
written O
in O
the O
label O
) O
, O
natural O
sugars O
basically O
, O
like O
apple O
pie O
( O
seriously O
) O
. O

And O
I O
can O
eat O
anything O
I O
want O
really O
so O
long O
as O
it O
’s O
paired O
properly O
and O
moderate O
- O
a O
piece O
of O
pizza O
with O
a O
big O
salad O
, O
shrimp O
salad O
with O
noodles O
. O

Exercise O
after O
eating O
helps O
lower O
numbers O
, O
so O
I O
save O
my O
household O
chores O
or O
things O
I O
need O
to O
run O
around O
to O
do O
for O
after O
I O
eat O
and O
it O
helps O
a O
lot O
. O

And O
basically O
since O
starting O
metformin B-DRUG
, O
even O
my O
after O
meal O
numbers O
are O
on O
a O
downward O
trend O
, O
so O
cheat O
meals O
allowed O
now O
! O

It O
’s O
all O
pretty O
scary O
at O
first O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
those O
that O
did O
n’t O
sleep O
and O
cried O
for O
a O
week O
. O

My O
partner O
is O
very O
supportive O
and O
joins O
the O
diet O
with O
me O
for O
our O
meals O
together O
and O
has O
enjoyed O
losing O
weight O
with O
it O
. O

He O
’s O
also O
verbally O
supportive O
about O
how O
well O
I O
’m O
doing O
. O

That O
little O
acknowledgment O
and O
kindness O
helps O
a O
ton O
. O

My O
advice O
to O
myself O
and O
you O
is O
to O
keep O
the O
habits O
built O
in O
mind O
afterward O
because O
risk O
favors O
for O
GD O
are O
similar O
to O
risk O
factors O
for O
Type O
2 O
but O
you O
do O
n’t O
have O
to O
go O
on O
to O
have O
Type O
2 O
if O
you O
work O
on O
sensible O
eating O
now O
. O

Do O
n’t O
worry O
. O

You O
got O
this O
! O

! O

And O
this O
sub O
is O
the O
best O
<3 O

Wtf O
your O
doctors O
are O
wrong O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n’t O
think O
you O
need O
a O
gyno O
, O
they O
are O
n’t O
particularly O
well O
qualified O
to O
treat O
PCOS O
. O

Can O
you O
get O
to O
an O
endocrinologist O
? O

They O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
actually O
have O
expertise O
in O
hormonal O
and O
metabolic O
health O
, O
including O
PCOS O
. O

Not O
all O
of O
them O
are O
good O
or O
up O
- O
to O
- O
date O
on O
the O
research O
but O
the O
odds O
of O
them O
actually O
being O
helpful O
are O
going O
to O
be O
better O

 O
It O
’s O
important O

that O
everyone O

Figuring O
out O
what O

 O
For O
example O

what O

me O

me O
process O

better O

I O

 O
Some O

my O

loss B-ADR

and O
that O
’s O
it O
, O
according O
to O
what O
my O
doctor O
thinks O

Why O
give O
lasix B-DRUG

the O
CHF O

.. O
just O
crank O
up O
the O
heat O

sweat O
it O
off O
! O

! O


Yeah O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
reaction B-ADR
is O
something O
you O
immediately O
talk O
with O
your O
doctor O
about O
, O
not O
just O
the O
internet O
. O

Did O
you O
just O
start O
taking O
Lisinopril B-DRUG

or O
have O
you O
been O
on O
it O
for O

? O


This O
was O
almost O
my O
exact O
same O
situation O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
, O
but O
i O
think O
it O
might O
ve O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
for O
me O
because O
i O
picked O
up O
a O
smoking O
habit O

I O
ve O
since O
changed O
to O
prozac B-DRUG

it O
is O
nt O
doing O
really O
well O
, O
so O
i O
m O
gon O
na O
change O
it O
to O
something O
else O
soon O
most O
likely O

There O
's O
no O
known O

healthier O

a O
good O
idea O
, O
in O
general O

you O

currently O

 O
Been O

20 O
mg O
Adderall B-DRUG
for O
3 O
weeks O
now O
, O
and O
I O
've O
noticed O
a O
huge O
difference O
in O
my O
day O
to O
day O
mental O
function O
. O

Easy O
to O
stay O
on O
task O
, O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
ups O
and O
downs O
of O

in O
the O
morning O
, O
just O
consistent O
wakeful O
and O
awareness O
. O



 O
IMO O
, O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
try O
and O
get O
the O
Adderall B-DRUG
increased O
or O
add O
IR O
10 O
mg O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

20 O
mg O
XR O
is O
a O
very O
low O
dose O
. O

I O
'm O
6 O
ft O
1 O
, O
285lbs O
, O
so O
20 O
mg O
XR O
does O
the O
minimum O
. O

Starts O
to O
fade O
early O
afternoon O
of O
taken O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Would O
love O
to O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
that O
level O
of O
clarity O
until O
5 O
- O
6PM O
for O
my O
family O
and O
Kids O
. O

Long O
days O
can O
take O
it O
out O
one O
, O
but O
I O
love O
spending O
time O
with O
my O
family O
after O
work O
. O



 O
All O
in O
all O
, O
love O
the O
combo O
so O
far O
. O

Would O
like O
to O
titrate O
the O
Prozac B-DRUG
down O
from O
60 O
to O
40 O
, O
20 O
, O
10 O
then O
off O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
taking O
all O
three O
has O
its O
benefits O
, O
but O
I O
almost O
feel O
like O
I O
'm O
being O
" O
over O
" O
medicated O
. O

That O
make O
sense O
? O

Lol O

I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O

) O
. O


He O
is O
genuinely O
next O
level O
stupid O
. O

He O
has O
such O
a O
strong O
opinion O
about O
something O
else O
that O
he O
is O
clueless O
about O
: O
Insulin O
is O
used O
by O
people O
suffering O
from O
type O
one O
diabetes O
, O
which O
is O
not O
related O

He O
is O
confusing O
it O
with O
type O
II O
diabetes O
, O
which O
can O
be O
weight O
related O
( O
but O
is O
n’t O
always O
) O
and O
which O
is O
treated O
by O
other O
medications O
such O
as O
metformin B-DRUG
. O

What O
an O
absolute O
moron O
. O


Actually O
It O
’s O
confusing O
. O


I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
gastritis B-ADR
last O
two O
months O
unfortunately O
it O
all O
started O
November O
last O
year O
but O
due O
to O
not O
knowing O
what O
was O
wrong O
I O
was O
so O
scared O
and O
worried O
about O
my O
health O
that O
I O
was O
n’t O
sleeping O
, O
eating O
well O
or O
doing O
anything O
normal O
anymore O
. O

I O
lost B-ADR
alot I-ADR
of I-ADR
weight I-ADR
, O
when O
I O
checked O
into O
the O
hospital O
panicking O
, O
the O
doctor O
checked O
my O
blood O
pressure O
and O
it O
was O
160/70 O
or O
so O
yeah O
and O
he O
immediately O
gave O
me O
a O
pill O
to O
put O
under O
my O
tongue O
and O
gave O
me O
5 O
mg O
both O
of O
amlodipine B-DRUG
and O
lisinopril B-DRUG
which O
as O
at O
now O
beginning O
to O
understand O
this O
whole O
thing O
, O
he O
did O
wrong O
giving O
me O
bp O
meds O
immediately O
instead O
of O
telling O
me O
to O
calm O
down O
and O
control O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
, O
ever O
since O
then O
I O
’ve O
checked O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
and O
I O
’m O
always O
150/70 O
or O
150/90 O
and O
rightly O
so O
cuz O
i O
was O
so O
tensed O
up O
last O
4 O
months O
ago O
but O
now O
i O
m O
abit O
calmer O
and O
I O
believe O
if O
I O
check O
my O
bp O
without O
meds O
it O
would O
still O
be O
in O
probably O
the O
130 O
range O
so O
I O
guess O
the O
doctor O
should O
n’t O
have O
put O
me O
on O
meds O
, O
he O
was O
just O
scared O
initially O
my O
bp O
was O
as O
high O
as O
160 O
but O
now O
I O
’ve O
learnt O
that O
when O
you O
’re O
sick B-ADR
it O
’s O
normal O
for O
your O
bp O
to O
shoot O
to O
extreme O
levels O
most O
especially O
when O
very O
very O
sick B-ADR
… O
is O
it O
too O
late O
to O
stop O
meds O
? O

And O
try O
to O
control O
normally O
with O
exercise O
and O
diet O
? O


Dupixent B-DRUG
all O
the O

a O

the O

she O
claimed O
the O
religious O
exemption O

i O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
has O
ever O
taken O
an O

was O

, O
anxiety B-ADR
hit O
me O
from O
nowhere O
4 O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
started O
with O
breathing O
exercises O
but O
at O
some O
point O
I O
had O
to O
accept O
that O
I O
needed O
medication O
. O

I O
take O
one O
sertraline B-DRUG
pill O
daily O
and O
now O
I O
am O
much O
better O
. O

Anxiety B-ADR
is O
almost O
gone O
. O

Obviously O
when O
things O
are O
really O
hard O
, O
I O
get O
back O
shortness O
and O
pressure B-ADR
in I-ADR
chest I-ADR
but O
it O
is O
less O
much O
less O
than O
before O
. O


Thank O
you O
for O
sharing O
with O
me O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
that O
you O
are O
not O
panic B-ADR
free O
. O

I O
tried O
Lexapro B-DRUG
before O
and O
it O
had O
me O
rush O
to O
the O
er O
. O

I O
felt O
crazy O
burning B-ADR
sensations I-ADR
on O
my O
chest O
, O
low O
energy O
, O
felt O
like O
i O
was O
sick B-ADR
and O
just O
wanted O
to O
lay O
in O
my O
bed O
.. O
it O
was O
only O
for O
3 O
days O
taking O
it O
and O
it O
also O
happened O
on O
zoloft B-DRUG
. O

I O
m O
prescribed O
now O
gabapentin B-DRUG
and O
xanax B-DRUG
now O
, O
but O
because O
of O
the O
experiences O
on O
those O
ssris O
, O
i O
am O
terrified O
to O
go O
through O
it O
again O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
i O
would O
start O
with O
half O
the O
xanax B-DRUG
doctor O
prescribed O
at O
first O
to O
see O
how O
i O
feel O
and O
gradually O
take O
more O
until O
what O
is O
prescibed O
and O
hopefully O
can O
take O
the O
gabapentin B-DRUG
at O
night O
. O

Again O
, O
thank O
you O
so O
much O
. O


My O
regimen O
prior O
to O
pregnancy O
included O
lisinopril B-DRUG
, O
Aldactone B-DRUG
, O
which O
they O
immediately O
removed O
once O
pregnant O
. O

If O
it O
was O
n’t O
safe O
to O
continue O
through O
pregnancy O
… O

I O
felt O
so O
awesome O
on O
remicade B-DRUG
. O

My O
UC O
was O
the O
best O
it O
's O
been O
since O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
. O

Developed O
antibodies O
though O
and O
now O
I O
'm O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
which O
sucks O
. O


I O
absolutely O
understand O
that O
you O
can O
not O
possibly O
educate O
about O
every O
single O
medication O
change O
, O
and O
educating O
about O
medication O
is O
absolutely O
within O
an O
RN O
's O
scope O
. O

However O
, O
pain B-ADR
medication O
is O
incredibly O
important O
to O
patients O
. O

Most O
patients O
truly O
do O
not O
care O
and O
will O
not O
remember O
if O
you O
add/ O
change O
metoprolol B-DRUG
, O
pepcid B-DRUG
, O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
, O
switch O
one O
antibiotic O
for O
another O
, O
etc O
. O

However O
they O
will O
DEFINITELY O
CARE O
if O
the O
q O
4 O
dilaudid B-DRUG
they O
've O
been O
getting O
around O
the O
clock O
for O
a O
week O
has O
been O
suddenly O
discontinued O
or O
switched O
to O
oxycodone B-DRUG
with O
no O
warning O
. O

Then O
they O
're O
screaming O
at O
me O
to O
page O
you O
at O
3 O
am O
for O
an O
explanation O
. O

Or O
worse O
, O
expecting O
you O
to O
come O
to O
the O
bedside O
at O
3 O
am O
. O

No O
one O
wants O
that O
! O


I O
thought O
that O
as O
well O
. O

There O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
language O
barrier O
between O
my O
psychiatrist O
and O
I O
on O
top O
of O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
she O
's O
great O
at O
listening O
or O
honestly O
that O
great O
in O
generally O
being O
that O
when O
I O
told O
her O
I O
was O
concerned O
about O
serotonin B-ADR
syndrome I-ADR
she O
said O
adhd O
meds O
do O
n't O
do O
anything O
with O
serotonin O
. O

Unfortunately O
I O
ca O
n't O
find O
a O
new O
one O
who O
will O
take O
my O
insurance O
or O
that O
is O
n't O
booked O
for O
a O
year O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
chonk O
and O
a O
smoker O
which O
both O
effect O
how O
medication O
is O
absorbed O
so O
I O
tried O
to O
be O
understanding O
. O

Also O
it O
's O
extended O
release O
so O
it O
's O
really O
just O
30 O
twice O
a O
day O
. O

Which O
still O
sounds O
high O
especially O
considering O
she O
started O
me O
at O
20 O
. O

I O
came O
here O
to O
see O
what O
others O
were O
saying O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
really O
trust O
her O
judgement O
so O
I O
tried O
10 O
mg O
of O
the O
immediate O
twice O
daily O
because O
I O
read O
that O
my O
lack O
of O
improvement O
could O
be O
because O
I O
'm O
taking O
too O
much O
but O
it O
had O
almost O
zero O
effect O
on O
me O
. O

As O
far O
as O
my O
depression B-ADR
goes O
, O
the O
meds O
were O
n't O
helping O
much O
anyway O
and O
I O
feel O
I O
've O
finally O
come O
to O
a O
point O
where O
I O
can O
manage O
it O
mostly O
on O
my O
own O
. O

Since O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
fluoxetine B-DRUG
I O
've O
also O
had O
improvements O
in O
other O
areas O
that O
were O
side O
effects O
I O
did O
n't O
notice O
I O
was O
even O
having O
until O
I O
stopped O
. O



> O
Propanolol O
can O
stop O
this O
part O
of O
the O
brain O
and O
the O
adrenal O
glands O
getting O
activated O
from O
a O
negative O
stimulus O
through O
memory O
reconsolidation O
therapy O
with O
exposure O
therapy O
. O



 O
Again O
, O
this O
is O
something O
that O
pertains O
to O
TRAUMA O
. O

Dysphoria B-ADR
is O
n't O
trauma O
. O

On O
my O
prior O
comment O
I O
also O
linked O
a O
study O
that O
concluded O
that O
there O
's O
literally O
NO O
DIFFERENCE O
between O
doing O
exposure O
therapy O
and O
memory O
reactivation O
with O
and O
WITHOUT O
propanolol B-DRUG
. O



 O
If O
it O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
change O
anything O
for O
trauma O
, O
which O
is O
it O
's O
actual O
proposed O
experimental O
use O
, O
why O
would O
it O
work O
for O
dysphoria B-ADR
which O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
trauma O
? O


Humira B-DRUG
, O
Taltz B-DRUG
, O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
are O
3 O
big O
ones O
. O

I O
'm O
actually O
going O
Tuesday O
to O
finally O
make O
the O
plunge O
into O
one O
of O
them O
since O
I O
'm O
in O
the O
same O
boat O
as O
you O
. O



 O
If O
you O
've O
done O
chemo O
before O
there O
might O
be O
some O
factors O
, O
but O
never O
hurts O
to O
ask O
. O


I O
also O
take O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
/ O
HCTZ B-DRUG
, O
and O
Metoprolol B-DRUG
ER O
. O

I O
’m O
constantly O
lightheaded B-ADR
. O

It O
’s O
the O
medicine O
. O

I O
’m O
  O
4 O
months O
in O
with O
that O
combination O
. O

I O
am O
noticing O
that O
my O
numbers O
are O
getting O
below O
normal O
. O

Do O
you O
check O
your O
readings O
daily O
? O

I O
’d O
recommend O
doing O
so O
at O
different O
times O
of O
the O
day O
. O

Low B-ADR
blood I-ADR
pressure I-ADR
causes O
dizziness B-ADR
, O
and O
it O
’s O
also O
a O
know O
side O
effect O
of O
the O
meds O
. O


I O
am O
so O
sorry O
you O
’re O
experiencing O
so O
much O
pain B-ADR
. O

It O
is O
a O
miserable O
place O
to O
be O
, O
as O
all O
of O
us O
in O
this O
sub O
know O
too O
well O
. O

Also O
, O
congratulations O
on O
your O
baby O
! O

I O
have O
a O
few O
thoughts O
, O
which O
I O
hope O
can O
be O
helpful O
. O



 O
1 O
. O

Regarding O
the O
neuropathy B-ADR
issues O
, O
have O
you O
been O
referred O
out O
to O
see O
a O
neurologist O
? O

That O
is O
unfortunately O
not O
a O
quick O
fix O
, O
but O
a O
neurologist O
might O
be O
the O
best O
person O
to O
help O
address O
those O
issues O
. O

A O
rheumatologist O
is O
somewhat O
outside O
of O
their O
wheelhouse O
with O
that O
. O

Neurologists O
can O
recommend O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
medications O
to O
help O
address O
the O
pain B-ADR
related O
to O
that O
. O



 O
2 O
. O

If O
you O
’re O
noticing O
the O
muscle O
pain B-ADR
is O
specific O
to O
the O
period O
of O
time O
immediately O
following O
your O
infusions O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
that O
this O
seems O
important O
. O

Once O
could O
be O
a O
coincidence O
, O
but O
if O
it O
is O
happening O
over O
and O
over O
, O
that O
does O
significant O
. O

I O
know O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
I O
had O
an O
“ O
ambassador O
” O
from O
Abvie O
that O
I O
could O
call O
to O
ask O
questions O
about O
the O
medication O
. O

Is O
there O
anything O
like O
that O
for O
Remicade B-DRUG
? O

A O
patient O
hotline O
for O
medication O
questions O
? O

If O
your O
doctor O
does O
n’t O
have O
answers O
, O
it O
’s O
worth O
a O
shot O
. O



 O
3 O
. O

Did O
your O
doctor O
mention O
or O
discuss O
the O
possibility O
of O
an O
allergy B-ADR
to O
the O
medication O
? O

Just O
because O
something O
did O
n’t O
occur O
in O
a O
drug O
trial O
does O
n’t O
mean O
it O
’s O
impossible O
for O
you O
to O
experience O
; O
clinical O
trials O
help O
but O
are O
n’t O
perfect O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
you O
’re O
having O
a O
decidedly O
adverse O
reaction B-ADR
to O
this O
medication O
, O
whether O
it O
’s O
an O
allergy B-ADR
or O
a O
side O
effect O
. O

I O
just O
want O
to O
validate O
that O
even O
if O
your O
doctor O
is O
brushing O
this O
off O
, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
typical O
response O
. O

If O
it O
is O
an O
allergy B-ADR
, O
you O
may O
find O
your O
response O
intensifies O
with O
each O
exposure O
. O

If O
it O
’s O
a O
side O
effect O
, O
it O
does O
n’t O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
tolerable O
one O
. O

I O
think O
you O
have O
every O
right O
to O
persist O
with O
your O
doctor O
and O
let O
them O
know O
you O
’re O
not O
tolerating O
this O
medication O
well O
and O
ask O
them O
what O
your O
next O
steps O
are O
. O


Well O
I O
just O
took O
the O
Prozac B-DRUG
lol O
now O
I O
’m O
having O
anxiety B-ADR
about O
it O
😬 O

How O
many O
mg O
of O
Prozac B-DRUG
were O
you O
on O
? O

And O
did O
you O
experience O
any O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
that O
come O
with O
continuous O
SSRI O
dosage O
? O


I O
had O
my O
first O
gout B-ADR
attack O
in O
March O
of O
2010 O
. O

  O
I O
was O
37 O
years O
old O
. O

  O
I O
spent O
almost O
11 O
years O
trying O
to O
control O
it O
through O
diet O
and O
other O
means O
. O

  O
I O
tracked O
everything O
I O
ate O
at O
times O
. O

  O
Those O
11 O
years O
were O
hell O
. O

  O
I O
could O
control O
it O
for O
a O
bit O
, O
then O
I O
would O
have O
an O
attack O
I O
could O
n't O
figure O
out O
. O

  O
By O
the O
end O
, O
I O
was O
basically O
always O
in O
at O
least O
a O
minor O
attack O
with O
full O
on O
attacks O
every O
6 O
- O
8 O
weeks O
. O

  O
For O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
I O
rarely O
could O
wear O
a O
normal O
shoe O
. O

  O
Were O
it O
not O
for O
me O
being O
100 O
% O
remote O
at O
work O
I O
would O
have O
had O
to O
give O
up O
trying O
to O
control O
it O
earlier O
and O
went O
on O
meds O
. O

  O
I O
just O
did O
not O
want O
to O
take O
something O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
so O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
fight O
a O
losing O
battle O
that O
may O
have O
damaged O
my O
joints O
anyway O
. O



 O
In O
December O
of O
2021 O
I O
went O
on O
Allo O
. O

  O
The O
first O
little O
bit O
was O
kind O
of O
rough O
, O
but O
still O
better O
than O
without O
Allo O
. O

  O
I O
think O
it O
was O
about O
6 O
months O
in O
when O
I O
realized O
that O
even O
what O
I O
was O
calling O
attacks O
now O
were O
not O
much O
more O
than O
a O
normal O
day O
before O
. O

About O
10 O
months O
in O
I O
stubbed O
my O
big O
toe O
and O
did O
n't O
have O
an O
attack O
from O
it O
. O

  O
That O
was O
my O
big O
turning O
point O
. O



 O
Do O
I O
still O
get O
some O
issues O
16 O
months O
down O
the O
road O
? O

  O
Sure O
. O

  O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
anyone O
ever O
fully O
gets O
away O
from O
occasional O
soreness B-ADR
or O
creakiness O
and O
maybe O
some O
swelling B-ADR
, O
especially O
with O
11 O
years O
of O
damage O
behind O
them O
. O

  O
What O
do O
I O
have O
to O
do O
about O
them O
now O
to O
keep O
them O
from O
becoming O
attacks O
? O

  O
Drink O
more O
water O
, O
take O
Aleve B-DRUG
morning O
and O
night O
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O

  O
When O
was O
my O
last O
colchicine B-DRUG
or O
prednisone B-DRUG
? O

  O
Sometime O
last O
year O
around O
the O
time O
my O
dad O
died O
and O
I O
had O
a O
mess O
of O
a O
life O
for O
a O
bit O
. O

  O
I O
recently O
got O
some O
colchicine B-DRUG
refilled O
just O
in O
case O
, O
but O
that O
was O
4 O
months O
after O
I O
last O
ran O
out O
and O
it O
has O
been O
sitting O
here O
about O
a O
month O
now O
without O
me O
needing O
it O
. O


LTC O
pharmacy O
I O
was O
working O
as O
an O
intern O
, O
tech O
transcribed O
“ O
Levobid B-DRUG
” O
0.375 O
mg O
BID O
as O
Levothyroxine B-DRUG
0.375 O
mg O
BID O
for O
a O
90 O
yo O
F O
< O
80 O
kg O
. O

Should O
have O
been O
Levbid B-DRUG
( O
Hyoscyamine B-DRUG
) O
. O

RPh O
verified O
order O
entry O
and O
pill O
pack O
. O

Ca O
n’t O
remember O
how O
many O
doses O
she O
received O
, O
but O
had O
a O
stroke B-ADR
and O
died B-ADR
. O



 O
2nd O
one O
I O
made O
as O
a O
hospital O
pharmacist O
taking O
a O
medication O
history O
. O

Ca O
n’t O
remember O
how O
I O
exactly O
phrased O
the O
question O
, O
but O
asked O
something O
like O
you O
take O
Lasix B-DRUG
20 O
mg O
tablets O
, O
three O
times O
a O
day O
? O

No O
, O
I O
take O
3 O
tablets O
, O
3 O
times O
a O
day O
. O

So O
I O
changed O
med O
list O
to O
Lasix B-DRUG
60 O
mg O
TID O
. O

Ordered O
inpatient O
as O
60 O
mg O
TID O
for O
3 O
days O
. O

  O
Patient O
got O
dehydrated O
, O
hypoK O
, O
AKI O
. O

Recovered O
fine O
. O


Yep O
, O
and O
to O
give O
more O
detail O
, O
my O
ACR O
score O
is O
150 O
! O

! O

Down O
from O
710 O
. O

Now O
obviously O
this O
is O
likely O
in O
flux O
, O
and O
my O
true O
numbers O
is O
probably O
between O
150 O
and O
710 O
, O
but O
still O
a O
huge O
sigh O
of O
relief O
. O

And O
I O
do O
see O
less O
bubbles O
in O
my O
urine O
, O
usually O
. O



 O
Also O
I O
forgot O
to O
mention O
. O



 O
After O
the O
doctors O
visit O
, O
remembering O
what O
you O
said O
, O
I O
bought O
an O
off O
the O
shelf O
blood O
pressure O
thingy O
, O
and O
checked O
myself O
multiple O
times O
the O
next O
week O
. O

Blood O
pressure O
was O
definitely O
on O
the O
relatively O
high O
side O
. O

Messaged O
my O
doctor O
and O
she O
prescribed O
me O
lisinopril B-DRUG
. O



 O
And O
even O
Jardiance B-DRUG
, O
the O
SGLT2 O
inhibitor O
, O
I O
had O
to O
PUSH O
her O
to O
get O
it O
. O

  O
I O
kept O
pushing O
and O
she O
said O
she O
'll O
check O
with O
a O
colleague O
, O
and O
that O
colleague O
prescribed O
my O
Jardiance B-DRUG
. O



 O
So O
now O
armed O
with O
an O
ACE O
inhibitor O
and O
the O
SGLT2 O
inhibitor O
originally O
prescribed O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
the O
affects O
are O
great O
! O




 O
If O
I O
had O
n't O
received O
information O
from O
you O
and O
another O
redditor O
, O
I O
would O
be O
on O
zero O
blood O
pressure O
meds O
. O

I O
know O
this O
is O
progressive O
, O
but O
hopefully O
I O
've O
slowed O
the O
process O
enough O
. O

I O
shudder O
at O
where O
I O
would O
be O
right O
now O
. O

I O
'm O
overjoyed O
, O
wifes O
overjoyed O
, O
thanks O
again O
! O

! O


I O
'm O
also O
going O
to O
take O
selnak B-DRUG
and O
semax B-DRUG
with O
prozac B-DRUG
. O

I O
read O
its O
find O

In O
my O
non O
- O
medical O
opinion O
, O
your O
heart O
rate O
may O
be O
fine O
at O
80 O
. O

You O
're O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
scale O
. O

But O
I O
would O
say O
getting O
that O
blood B-ADR
pressure I-ADR
down I-ADR
needs O
to O
be O
a O
priority O
- O
it O
's O
definitely O
too O
high O
. O

Metoprolol B-DRUG
is O
great O
for O
getting O
your O
heart O
rate O
down O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
like O
you O
need O
to O
concentrate O
on O
the O
systolic O
and O
diastolic O
numbers O
. O



 O
My O
doctor O
uses O
a O
combination O
med O
approach O
for O
me O
- O
12.5 O
mg O
Metoprolol B-DRUG
twice O
a O
day O
( O
in O
the O
past O
, O
my O
heart O
rate O
was O
too O
often O
in O
the O
90s O
, O
so O
I O
've O
been O
on O
Metoprolol B-DRUG
for O
years O
) O
, O
Amlodipine B-DRUG
( O
calcium O
channel O
blocker O
) O
2.5 O
mg O
once O
a O
day O
, O
and O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
( O
ACE O
inhibitor O
) O
5 O
mg O
once O
a O
day O
. O

Extremely O
low O
doses O
of O
all O
three O
meds O
, O
but O
the O
combination O
has O
been O
successful O
for O
me O
. O

Best O
of O
luck O
to O
you O

Prozac B-DRUG
is O
a O
much O
milder O
medication O
to O
go O
on O
if O
you O
’re O
looking O
to O
take O
it O
for O
only O
a O
few O
days O
out O
of O
the O
month O
. O

Zoloft B-DRUG
will O
have O
many O
more O
side O
effects O
. O

Prozac B-DRUG
also O
self O
tapers O
over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
week O
so O
you O
wo O
n’t O
have O
withdrawals O
from O
taking O
it O
for O
the O
shorter O
time O
. O

If O
you O
are O
wanting O
to O
go O
on O
an O
SSRI O
for O
everyday O
then O
either O
is O
worth O
a O
shot O
, O
I O
’ve O
been O
in O
both O
and O
personally O
liked O
Prozac B-DRUG
a O
lot O
more O
because O
the O
side O
effects O
were O
minimal O
. O


> O
I O
drink O
a O
ton O
more O
water O
since O
it O
seems O
to O
make O
me O
very O
thirsty B-ADR

 O
The O

I O

BSing O
him O
when O
I O
was O
presenting O

lifestyle O
changes O
. O

I O
beat O
type O
2 O
two O
years O
after O
my O
diagnosis O
because O
I O
took O
it O
seriously O
. O

It O
upset O
me O
to O
see O
people O
eating O
bags O
of O
candy O
and O
fast O
food O
making O
themselves O
blind O
and O
not O
taking O
it O
seriously O
. O

I O
took O
metformin B-DRUG

diet O
covered O
the O
rest O
. O

that O
was O
so O
triggering O
to O
read O
. O

I O
’ve O
actually O
decided O
to O
stop O
taking O
Zoloft B-DRUG
bc O
the O
side O
effects O
just O
are O
n’t O
worth O
it O
. O

I O
do O
have O
hydroxine B-DRUG
and O
I O
took O
that O
a O

better- O

little O
shaky B-ADR
. O

and O
just O
having O
these O
symptoms O
scares O

badly O

Hi O
, O
great O
post O
! O

I O
tried O
clonidine B-DRUG
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
do O
nothing O
and O
am O
now O
on O
Propanolol B-DRUG
. O

I O
’m O
taking O
80mg/ O
day O
, O
extended O
release O
. O

Have O
you O
tried O
the O
ER O
version O
? O

Like O
you O
said O
, O
that O
’s O
a O
lot O
of O
pills O
to O
have O
to O
take O
every O
day O
! O



 O
Now O
I O
’m O
wondering O
if O
I O
should O
try O
the O
Clonidine B-DRUG
and O
Propanolol B-DRUG
together O
? O

🤔 O

Humira B-DRUG
worked O
well O
for O
about O
2 O
years O
, O
I O
then O
had O
to O
have O
an O
operation O
and O
a O
break O
of O
about O
2 O
months O
then O
when O
I O
restarted O
I O
went O
onto O
a O
biosimilar O
“ O
imiraldi B-DRUG
” O
instead O
which O
never O
felt O
quite O
so O
effective O
and O
after O
about O
a O
year O
I O
was O
tested O
for O
antibodies O
which O
was O
positive O
and O
because O
of O
“ O
covid O
” O
it O
was O
immediately O
stopped O
. O

   O
Over O
the O
first O
year O
of O
covid O
they O
were O
reluctant O
to O
start O
new O
patients O
on O
biologics O
in O
the O
UK O
who O
had O
other O
risk O
factors O
so O
had O
some O
steroids O
which O
were O
ok O
and O
some O
DMARD O
’s O
which O
wernt O
and O
NSAIDS O
, O
  O
I O
was O
then O
supposed O
to O
start O
a O
drug O
trial O
for O
“ O
remicade B-DRUG
injection O
pens O
” O
about O
a O
year O
after O
coming O
off O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
I O
was O
too O
old O
to O
qualify O
for O
the O
trial O
so O
eventually O
a O
few O
months O
later O
I O
went O
onto O
“ O
Benepali B-DRUG
” O
a O
biosimilar O
of O
“ O
Enteracept B-DRUG
/ O
Enbrel B-DRUG
” O
because O
the O
antibody O
creation O
risk O
is O
lower O
, O
which O
I O
started O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
. O



 O
Officially O
I O
should O
have O
moved O
onto O
“ O
remicade B-DRUG
infusions O
” O
but O
they O
wanted O
to O
wait O
until O
covid O
had O
subsided O
before O
adding O
more O
people O
to O
the O
transfusion O
list O
at O
my O
local O
hospital O
, O
so O
if O
the O
Benepali B-DRUG
loses O
its O
efficacy O
or O
I O
decide O
I O
want O
to O
I O
can O
switch O
to O
the O
infusions O
which O
may O
be O
more O
effective O
. O



 O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
very O
late O
, O
my O
diagnosis O
path O
has O
been O
used O
as O
a O
UK O
case O
study O
to O
develop O
changes O
in O
the O
system O
to O
better O
protect O
people O
like O
myself O
. O

  O
I O
’m O
also O
used O
as O
a O
“ O
training O
patient O
” O
for O
year O
1 O
medical O
students O
at O
my O
local O
university O
and O
my O
doctors O
surgery O
uses O
me O
as O
a O
“ O
training O
patient O
” O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
conditions O
and O
for O
year O
5 O
exam O
students O
. O

  O
It O
’s O
nice O
to O
be O
able O
help O
the O
“ O
system O
” O
evolve O
but O
being O
diagnosed O
at O
48 O
around O
18 O
years O
after O
symptoms B-ADR
started O
I O
feel O
pretty O
let O
down O
. O

  O
But O
I O
have O
learned O
a O
lot O
during O
the O
time O
with O
all O
of O
these O
doctors O
and O
how O
the O
system O
should O
have O
worked O
, O
sometimes O
feels O
like O
I O
’m O
in O
the O
movie O
crimson O
tide O
as O
the O
reality O
of O
how O
those O
rules O
played O
out O
had O
unintended O
consequences O
! O



 O
The O
18 O
months O
or O
so O
with O
no O
treatment O
means O
the O
“ O
Benepali B-DRUG
” O
had O
to O
effectively O
start O
from O
scratch O
, O
I O
would O
say O
I O
’m O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
I O
was O
these O
days O
, O
probably O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
was O
when O
I O
started O
on O
the O
branded O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
the O
fatigue B-ADR
is O
still O
pretty O
dire O
. O

  O
I O
have O
some O
nerve B-ADR
compression I-ADR
in O
my O
lumbar O
spine O
from O
the O
long O
gap O
in O
treatment O
so O
I O
have O
to O
be O
a O
bit O
careful O
what O
I O
do O
. O

 

 O
Hope O
that O
helps O
… O

I O
have O
some O
, O
but O
ca O
n't O
use O
it O
as O
a O
comfort O
med O
bc O
am O
already O
on O
propanolol B-DRUG
.. O

With O
a O
statin O
, O
often O
, O
but O
not O
always O
, O
the O
doctor O
likes O
to O
order O
a O
Cardiac O
Calcium O
Scan O
which O
is O
an O
image O
of O
the O
heart O
and O
its O
arteries O
. O

Have O
you O
had O
a O
Scan O
yet O
? O

If O
not O
, O
you O
may O
wish O
to O
ask O
. O

Overall O
, O
your O
numbers O
are O
not O
that O
bad O
. O

A O
low O
dose O

of O
lipitor B-DRUG
, O
for O
example O
, O
of O
10 O
- O
20 O
mg O
, O
will O
help O
bring O
down O
the O
LDL O
and O
cholesterol O
numbers O
down O
. O

What O
you O
may O
want O
to O
suggest O
to O
do O
a O
trial O
of O
90 O
days O
to O
see O
if O
it O
makes O
a O
difference O
. O

If O
it O
does O
n’t O
then O
have O
the O
doctor O
develop O
a O
plan O
B. O
Overall O
, O
a O
low O
fat O
diet O
and O
exercise O
with O
help O
bring O
down O
those O
numbers O
too O
. O


I O
'm O
so O
sorry O
you O
are O
going O
through O
this O
. O

Please O
talk O
to O
a O
doctor O
again O
for O
a O

check O
if O
you O
can O

Do O
you O

with O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
wait O
at O
most O
. O



  O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
taking O
propanolol B-DRUG
after O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
because O
it O
put O
me O
in O
a O
huge O
downward O
spiral O
mentally O
. O

My O
occasional O
depression B-ADR
worsened I-ADR
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O

off O

It O

I O
have O
n’t O
been O
on O
Gileyna B-DRUG

I O
was O
noticiable O
immunosuppressed B-ADR
when O
I O
was O
on O
Tecfidera B-DRUG
. O

If O
something O
went O
around O
where O
everyone O
was O
sick B-ADR
for O
2 O
days O
, O
I O
was O
sick B-ADR
for O
10 O

I O
ended O
up O
hospitalized O
for O
“ O
minor O

a O
couple O

times O

I O
’ve O
only O
been O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
during O
the O
pandemic O
and O
I O
’ve O
been O
super O
anal O
with O
precautions O
so O
I O
ca O
n’t O
really O
tell O
you O
how O
that O
’s O
effecting O
my O
immune O
system O
. O



 O
That O
said O
it O
’s O
definitely O
worth O
it O
, O
I O
had O
pretty O
aggressive O
MS B-ADR
at O
first- O
tons O
of O
lesions B-ADR
, O
multiple O
relapses O
a O
year- O
but O
my O
meds O
have O
almost O
totally O
knocked O
it O
into O
submission O
. O

I O
’ve O
also O
been O
taking O
precautions O
during O

years O
before O

( O
avoiding O

your O

to O
get O
the O
flu O
shot O
, O
etc O
) O
and O
it O
’s O
not O
awful O
once O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O

I O
’d O
rather O
take O
meds O
and O
avoid O
going O
to O
jam O
packed O
bars O
in O
the O
winter O

not O
take O
my O

end O
up O
blind O

something O

me O
Zoloft B-DRUG
( O

was O
horrible O
just O

I O
guess O
it O
could O
be O
due O

the O
fact O
that O
i O
lost B-ADR
weight I-ADR

i O

Maybe O

will O
help O
me O

I O
will O
definitely O

Why O
do O
n’t O
they O
do O
the O
double O

To O

Also O
having O
in O
mind O
that O

, O
could O
we O
say O
that O
the O
standard O
dose O
of O
ocrevus B-DRUG
is O
better O
than O
kesimpta B-DRUG
at O
doing O
this O
? O


almost O
18 O
years O
and O
counting O
( O
my O
entire O
life O
) O
and O
it O
does O
n’t O
look O
like O
it O
’s O
going O
away O
anytime O
soon O
. O

i O
’ve O
had O
1 O
actual O
remission O
i O
can O
remember O
, O
when O
i O
was O
taking O
antibiotics O
+ O
prednisone B-DRUG
and O
it O
lasted O
for O
about O
6 O
weeks O
. O

then O
it O
returned O
full O
force O

Just O
Plaquenil B-DRUG
now O
. O

I O
also O
started O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
, O
but O
tapered O
off O
within O
a O
month O
or O
so O
. O



 O
I O
think O
what O
people O
are O
taking O
varies O
with O
their O
type O
of O
lupus B-ADR
. O

I O
have O
SLE O
. O

So O
far O
, O
no O
kidney O
involvement O
. O


If O
it O
were O
me O
I O
would O
stop O
comparing O
my O
eating O
to O
peers O
and O
just O
eat O
healthy O
period O
. O



 O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
is O
good O
. O


It O
’s O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
get O
your O
vaccines O
/ O
booster O
before O
staring O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
. O

Evusheld B-DRUG
is O
injected O
long O
lasting O
antibodies O
( O
prophylactic O
) O
for O
those O
of O
us O
who O
do O
n’t O
make O
them O
. O

So O
it O
’s O
about O
every O
six O
months O
. O


Έχω O
πολύ O
κακή O
εμπειρία O

 O
I O

He O
was O

feeling O

is O
why O
he O
said O
" O

 O
Prednisone B-DRUG
will O
give O
you O
dead O
cat O
bounce O
vibes O
real O
bad O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
taper O
according O
to O
the O
Rx O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
see O
why O
dexamethasone B-DRUG
would O
be O
any O
different O
. O

Pred O
also O
gives O
you O
manic B-ADR
energy O
when O
you O
're O
on O
it O
. O


Within O
2 O
months O
on O
biweekly O
dosing O
, O
I O
had O
pretty O
much O
stabilized O
into O
the O
pattern O
of O
7 O
days O
of O
improvement O
, O
3 O
days O
of O
plateau O
, O
4 O
days O
of O
decline O
. O



 O
My O
insurance O
made O
me O
try O
every O
other O
biologic O
on O
the O
market O
before O
allowing O
me O
to O
try O
Humira B-DRUG
with O
weekly O
dosing O
. O

That O
took O
about O
3 O
years O
. O



 O
On O
weekly O
dosing O
, O
my O
response O
to O
the O
medication O
is O
pretty O
stable O
. O

No O
more O
ups O
and O
downs O
. O

But O
I O
also O
had O
to O
add O
Otezla B-DRUG
to O
put O
the O
disease O
completely O
into O
remission O
. O


I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
4 O
years O
to O
treat O
mild O
Crohns O
and O
joint O
point O
. O

  O
I O
have O
had O
no O
side O
effects O
and O
it O
has O
been O
great O
a O
treating O
my O
symptoms B-ADR
. O


When O
I O
took O
Concerta B-DRUG
, O
my O
chess O
score O
elevated O
. O

When O
I O
took O
Prozac B-DRUG
, O
it O
elevated O
further O
. O

So O
I O
think O
that O
they O
do O
assist O
in O
helping O
with O
focus O
. O



 O
Since O
those O
days O
, O
I O
incurred O
some O
brain O
damage O
and O
additional O
trauma O
where O
I O
now O
catch O
myself O
' O
day O
- O
dreaming O
' O
all O
kinds O
of O
random O
things O
, O
( O
almost O
as O
though O
my O
deep O
- O
psyche O
finds O
the O
current O
moment O
threatening O
, O
and O
as O
though O
my O
mind O
is O
constantly O
on O
" O
auto O
- O
distract O
" O
mode O
) O
. O



 O
And O
that O
's O
pretty O
much O
what O
ADD O
is O
at O
it O
's O
core O
. O

So O
I O
think O
the O
link O
to O
trauma O
is O
very O
valid O
and O
, O
yes O
, O
the O
medications O
for O
actual O
ADD O
seem O
to O
be O
effective O
. O


Most O
Type O
2 O
diabetics O
, O
like O
me O
, O
, O
take O
Metformin B-DRUG
orally O
and O
do O
n't O
use O
insulin O
. O

Type O
1 O
diabetics O
essentially O
have O
it O
from O
birth O
. O

They O
are O
the O
diabetics O
who O
need O
insulin O
. O

I O
had O
a O
boss O
who O
was O
Type O
1 O
. O

He O
was O
skinny O
as O
a O
rail O
. O

An O
engineer O
, O
he O
was O
very O
careful O
about O
dosing O
and O
ended O
up O
with O
an O
insulin O
pump O
. O

  O
Politicians O
who O
say O
crap O
like O
he O
did O
are O
both O
ignorant O
and O
stupid O
. O


They O
destroyed O
my O
life O
, O
I O
'm O
severely O
disabled B-ADR
by O
Zoloft B-DRUG
. O


Jeez O
I O
'm O
so O
sorry O
you O
got O
ta O
go O
through O
that O
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
just O
recently O
started O
taking O
40 O
mg O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
to O
reduce O
his O
cholesterol O
levels O
since O
they O
are O
pretty O
high O
. O



 O
primary O
care O
doc O
says O
He O
is O
to O
finish O
a O
box O
of O
30 O
pills O
with O
diet O
and O
exercise O
and O
come O
back O
to O
another O
blood O
test O
to O
see O
if O
it O
's O
back O
to O
normal O
or O
if O
the O
pills O
will O
be O
his O
new O
regimen O
. O

Endocrinologist O
says O
not O
to O
until O
his O
second O
round O
of O
blood O
work O
comes O
back O
to O
see O
if O
he O
actually O
needs O
it O


  O
And O
he O
's O
only O
24 O


 O
If O
your O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
is O
in O
larger O
pills O
, O
i O
ca O
nt O
imagine O
what O
you O
're O
going O
through O
. O

I O
hope O
all O
is O
well O
and O
you O
have O
good O
health O
from O
here O
onwards O

Hi O
there O
, O
i O
live O
in O
Spain O
and O
i O
have O
a O
friend O
who O
is O
40F O
and O
trying O
to O
get O
pregnant O
. O

She O
was O
taking O
copaxone B-DRUG
but O
when O
she O
told O
her O
neuro O
that O
she O
wanted O
to O
get O
pregnant O
they O
switched O
her O
to O
ocrevus B-DRUG
. O

We O
are O
both O
being O
treated O
on O
a O
center O
which O
specializes O
only O
in O
MS O
, O
here O
all O
medications O
are O
free O
so O
they O
do O
n’t O
get O
anything O
by O
changing O
your O
medication O
, O
if O
anything O
ocrevus B-DRUG
is O
pricer O
than O
copaxone B-DRUG
so O
it O
costs O
more O
to O
the O
state O
.. O

Why O
is O
it O
not O
okay O
for O
a O
doctor O
to O
write O
a O
script O
( O
non O
control O
) O
for O
themselves O
? O



 O
I O
mean O
, O
there O
might O
be O
scenarios O
where O
the O
doc O
might O
want O
to O
see O
another O
doc O
to O
get O
an O
unbiased O
opinion O
, O
or O
if O
they O
have O
a O
complex O
medical O
problem O
and O
want O
to O
see O
another O
doc O
that O
specialized O
in O
that O
area O
( O
like O
a O
cardiologist O
going O
to O
an O
endocrinologist O
to O
seek O
treatment O
for O
PCOS O
or O
something O
) O


 O
But O
some O
situations O
are O
so O
cut O
and O
dry O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
to O
see O
another O
doc O
when O
you O
could O
just O
prescribe O
for O
yourself O
. O



 O
" O
Hmm O
, O
by O
blood O
pressure O

going O
there O

have O
weird O

after O

all O
you O
need O

important O

I O
have O
really O
stubborn O
psoriasis B-ADR
and O
literally O
nothing O
helps O
it O
but O
1 O
cream O
which O
is O
Beloderm B-DRUG
( O
I O
buy O
it O
in O
Europe O
cause O
it O
’s O
cheaper O
) O
but O
in O
the O
US O
it O
’s O
called O
Betamethasone B-DRUG
Dipropionate I-DRUG
. O

Please O
try O
it O
talk O
to O
a O
Derm O

get O
a O
script O
. O

When O
I O
have O
psoriasis B-ADR
on O
my O
face O
, O
it O
gets O
rid O
of O
it O
overnight O
and O
my O
patches O
look O
exactly O
like O
yours O
. O

Also O
I O
would O
recommend O
a O
biologic O
injectable O
. O

I O
’m O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
works O
great O


 O
Also O
for O
a O
“ O
home O
remedy O
” O
for O
the O
scalp B-ADR
psoriasis I-ADR
.. O
believe O
it O
or O
not O
I O
use O
olive O
oil O
all O
over O
my O
scalp O
when O
it O
flares O
up O
and O
put O
a O
shower O
cap O
on O
and O
sleep O
on O
it O
and O
wash O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

And O
tends O
to O
soften O
up O
the O
pso O
and O
calm O
it O
down O
and O
keeps O
it O
off O
the O
scalp O
for O
about O
a O
week O
. O


I O
was O
in O
denial O
until O
my O
massive O
flare B-ADR
in O
August O
. O

It O
literally O
took O
months O
to O
recover O
and O
I O
'm O
currently O
in O
therapy O
to O
learn O
to O
deal O
with O
my O
MS O
diagnosis O
/ O
limitations O
in O
a O
healthy O
way O
. O

During O
the O
5 O
years O
between O
my O
diagnosis O
and O
life O
changing O
flare B-ADR
I O
took O
the O
least O
effective O
medication O
, O
stayed O
with O
a O
neuro O
who O
did O
not O
specialize O
in O
MS O
and O
tried O
my O
hardest O
to O
live O
like O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
it O
. O

Oh O
did O
it O
bite O
me O
in O
the O
butt O
and O
leave O
me O
with O
so O
many O
regrets O
and O
new O
cervical B-ADR
lesions I-ADR
. O

I O
immediately O
started O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
and O
got O
a O
new O
doctor O
who O
specializes O
in O
MS O
. O

It O
was O
such O
a O
wake O
call O
and O
I O
wish O
it O
was O
handled O
before O
so O
much O
damage O
was O
done O
. O


With O
fluoxetine B-DRUG
I O
would O
not O
feel O
excited O
, O
even O
though O
I O
had O
erections O
. O

I O
could O
ejaculate O
, O
but O
no B-ADR
orgasm I-ADR
. O

Very O
strange O
stand O
point O

Get O
and O
fill O
" O
emergency O
prescriptions O
" O
for O
Prednisone B-DRUG
and O
Zofran B-DRUG
before O
he O
heads O
off O
to O
college O
. O

 

 O
Flare B-ADR
- I-ADR
ups I-ADR
will O
include O
uncontrollable O
vomiting B-ADR
and O
abdominal B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

  O
If O
one O
goes O
to O
an O
ER O
for O
treatment O
, O
they O
'll O
give O
Zofran B-DRUG
to O
stop O
the O
vomiting B-ADR
and O
Prednisone B-DRUG
to O
calm O
the O
flare B-ADR
( O
usually O
40 O
mg O
per O
day O
) O
. O

  O
I O
've O
saved O
myself O
two O
hospital O
stays O
by O
having O
these O
on O
hand O
. O

 

 O
Then O
call O
the O
GI O
for O
next O
steps O
, O
which O
may O
include O
trying O
a O
new O
medication O
, O
and O
will O
include O
instructions O
for O
tapering O
off O
Prednisone B-DRUG
. O


I O
started O
this O
a O
little O
over O
a O
month O
ago O
. O

Started O
at O
25 O
mg O
and O
went O
to O
50 O
after O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O

For O
bipolar O
and O
general O
paranoia B-ADR
and O
obsessive B-ADR
thoughts I-ADR
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
on O
so O
many O
things O
off O
and O
on O
through O
the O
years O
, O
and O
to O
so O
many O
psych O
wards O
, O
i O
honestly O
was O
convinced O
that O
nothing O
was O
ever O
going O
to O
work O
for O
me O
and O
just O
became O
really O
anti O
medication O
. O

Finally O
my O
mom O
told O
me O
to O
try O
this O
, O
as O
it O
worked O
wonders O
for O
my O
sister O
like O
8 O
years O
ago O
and O
she O
loves O
it O
and O
still O
takes O
it O
today O
. O

Immediate O
results O
. O

I O
also O
do O
take O
prozac B-DRUG
too O
. O

But O
the O
lamotrigine B-DRUG
was O
what O
made O
all O
the O
difference O
. O

I O
mean O
this O
shit O
is O
a O
godsend O
it O
is O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
’ve O
ever O
tried O
that O
has O
actually O
worked O
on O
so O
many O
levels O
for O
me O
, O
Literally O
every O
aspect O
of O
my O
life O
is O
back O
on O
track O
and O
I O
’m O
functioning O
like O
i O
never O
have O
for O
my O
entire O
life O
. O

After O
a O
month O
, O
i O
did O
kind O
of O
start O
to O
feel O
depressed B-ADR
and O
irritable B-ADR
and O
was O
also O
having O
like O
intrusive O
angry B-ADR
thoughts O
and O
was O
starting O
to O
isolate O
again O
. O

I O
honestly O
had O
no O
clue O
this O
was O
happening O
and O
it O
took O
my O
mom O
several O
tries O
to O
make O
me O
see O
. O

Dr O
increased O
the O
dose O
to O
100 O
mg O
a O
day O
now O
, O
and O
over O
the O
last O
3 O
days O
… O
especially O
today O
, O
i O
am O
feeling O
SO O
much O
better O
, O
so O
that O
’s O
one O
thing O
is O
I O
would O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
she O
/ O
he O
may O
need O
further O
increase O
if O
it O
stops O
working O
for O
them O
. O

I O
ca O
n’t O
tell O
you O
how O
close O
i O
was O
to O
killing O
myself O
bc O
i O
have O
been O
so O
miserable O
for O
years O
. O

I O
got O
off O
meth O
over O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
and O
was O
not O
improving O
the O
whole O
time O
. O

But O
this O
shit O
saved O
my O
fucking O
life O
i O
am O
so O
grateful O
for O
it O
, O

  O
my O

not O
that O
good O
. O


Have O
you O
tried O
propanolol B-DRUG
? O

  O
It O
helps O
block O
the O
sympathetic O
nervous O
system O
symptoms O
of O
panic B-ADR
attacks I-ADR
( O
e.g. O

It O
took O
a O

I O
currently O
take O
humira B-DRUG
weekly O
, O
and O
antibiotics O

topicals O
as O
needed O
. O

His O
best O
bet O
, O
if O
he O
's O
able O
, O
is O
to O
see O
a O
dermatologist O
, O
specifically O
one O
who O
specializes O
in O
HS O
. O


Well O
, O
Prednisone B-DRUG
is O
known O
for O
causing O
weight B-ADR
gain I-ADR
. O

  O
I O
had O
a O
friend O
in O
college O
who O
was O
only O
4'9 O
" O
and O
she O
was O
put O
on O
Prednisone B-DRUG
for O
kidney B-ADR
failure I-ADR
, O
and O
she O
gained B-ADR
20 I-ADR
lbs I-ADR
on O
her O
tiny O
frame O
. O

  O
Most O
of O
it O
went O
to O
her O
face O
and O
feet O
, O
which O
were O
very O
swollen O
. O



 O
OP O
lost O
inches O
in O
his O
belly O
while O
gaining O
pounds O
. O

  O
Maybe O
he O
is O
losing B-ADR
fat I-ADR
, O
gaining B-ADR
muscle I-ADR
, O
and O
having O
swelling B-ADR
all O
at O
once O
? O


If O
you O
are O
injecting O
yourself O
TRT O
you O
should O
n’t O
mess O
with O
your O
hormones O
with O
additional O
hormone O
altering O
supplements O
. O

It O
defeats O
the O
whole O
purpose O
of O
getting O
TRT O
and O
increases O
risks O
for O
imbalance O
. O


For O
the O
same O
reasons O
that O
if O
you O
are O
on O
averstatins O
you O
do O
n’t O
take O
Niacin B-DRUG
. O

Statin O
( O
Lipitor B-DRUG
) O
and O
Niacin B-DRUG
combination O
can O
actually O
lead O
to O
a O
rare O
reaction B-ADR
that O
can O
kill O
you O
. O


Boron O
in O
high O
doses O
can O
also O
kill O
you O
, O
so O
you O
do O
n’t O
know O
what O
it O
actually O
does O
to O
you O
when O
you O
take O
it O
with O
TRT O
. O


 
 O
Alone O
it O
’ll O
reduce O
estrogen O
, O
but O
why O
would O
you O
want O
to O
do O
that O
when O
you O
are O
already O
on O
TRT O
? O


Your O
body O
needs O
to O
maintain O
some O
balance O
you O
know O
? O

Estrogen O
is O
not O
meant O
to O
be O
minimized O
to O
max O
. O


10 O
mg O
is O
the O
lowest O
dose O
of O
lisinopril B-DRUG
used O
when O
managing O
hypertension B-ADR
, O
or O
high B-ADR
blood I-ADR
pressure I-ADR
. O

It O
sounds O
as O
though O
after O
using O
the O
medication O
, O
and O
some O
lifestyle O
changes O
, O
your O
BP O
has O
come O
back O
down O
to O
a O

normal O

healthy O
value O

 O
It O
's O
almost O

to O

whether O
this O
correction O
is O
due O
to O
the O

your O
lifestyle O
alone O
, O
or O
( O
more O

) O
, O
a O

 O
Given O
that O
your O
BP O
is O
n't O
high O
anymore O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
unreasonable O
to O
have O
a O
trial O
period O
without O
the O
medication O

to O
monitor O
your O
blood O
pressure O
to O
see O
if O
it O
goes O
back O
up O
. O

However O
, O
this O
is O
something O
that O
should O
always O
be O
done O
under O
the O
supervision O
of O
a O
physician O
, O
and O
with O
their O
knowledge O
and O
recommendation O
. O

It O
would O
100 O
% O
be O
worth O
asking O
your O
Dr O
when O
you O
speak O
to O
them O
in O
a O
few O
months O
time O
. O



 O
Given O
that O
you O
're O
on O
the O
lowest O
dose O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
have O
to O
ween O
yourself O
off O
, O
it O
'll O
just O
be O
a O
case O
of O
stopping O
it O
. O

You O
're O
unlikely O
to O
experience O
any O
symptoms O
when O
you O
miss O
a O
dose O
, O
as O
a O
) O
missing O
one O
day O
wo O
n't O
affect O
your O
blood O
pressure O
hugely O
, O
it O
's O
a O
change O
more O
seen O
over O
time O
, O
and O
b O
) O
unless O
very O
high O
, O
blood O
pressure O
does O
n't O
carry O
symptoms O
- O
people O
just O
know O
about O
it O
when O
things O
start O
to O
go O
wrong O
( O
i.e. O
strokes B-ADR
and O
heart B-ADR
attacks I-ADR
) O
. O



 O
So O
yeah O
, O
that O
's O
a O
long O
way O
of O
saying O
that O
a O
trial O
period O
without O
the O
meds O
would O
n't O
do O
you O
any O
harm O
, O
but O
you O
should O
talk O
to O
your O
Dr O
first O
and O
get O
their O
advice O
as O
they O
'll O
know O
you O
100x O
better O
than O
any O
of O
us O
will O
. O



 O
All O
the O
best O
. O


Thank O
you O
for O
the O
info O
. O

it O
's O
weird O
because O
metformin B-DRUG
really O
does O
work O
for O
him O
. O

we O
've O
seen O
it O
in O
action O
. O

he O
also O
does O
n't O
really O
have O
side O
effects O
from O
it O
and O
everyone O
is O
different O
. O

ED B-ADR
might O
be O
because O
he O
gets O
more O
anxious O
when O
he O
's O
higher O
so O
it O
might O
be O
a O
performance B-ADR
anxiety I-ADR
thing O
? O

he O
also O
ca O
n't O
feel O
much O
when O
he O
's O
high O
either O
though O
, O
but O
he O
thinks O
it O
's O
pretty O
normal O
for O
a O
diabetic O
so O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
how O
big O
of O
a O
deal O
it O
is O
. O

he O
should O
definitely O
talk O
to O
his O
doctor O
though O
. O



 O
there O
is O
an O
app O
from O
our O
pediatric O
hospital O
where O
he O
can O
confidentially O
talk O
to O
his O
doctor O
/ O
care O
team O
about O
his O
health O
. O

I O
just O
found O
out O
about O
this O
after O
making O
the O
post O
because O
I O
was O
talking O
to O
my O
mom O
about O
it O
( O
we O
go O
to O
the O
same O
hospital O
and O
have O
since O
my O
little O
brother O
with O
CF O
was O
born O
, O
so O
my O
mom O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
help O
with O
this O
. O

I O
research O
thanks O
to O
her O
) O
. O

I O
'm O
about O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
about O
it O
now O
. O



 O
We O
're O
honestly O
just O
trying O
to O
get O
through O
the O
school O
year O
and O
were O
just O
hit O
with O
covid O
so O
, O
he O
'll O
hopefully O
figure O
this O
out O
more O
in O
the O
summer O
. O

we O
're O
also O
both O
trying O
to O
save O
money O
to O
move O
out O
at O
18 O
so O
his O
parents O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
say O
anymore O
. O

I O
'll O
talk O
to O
him O
about O
seeing O
a O
different O
endo O
who O
deals O
with O
cases O
like O
his O
also O
. O

maybe O
they O
would O
have O
put O
him O
on O
insulin O
by O
now O
, O
even O
though O
his O
pancreas O
still O
produces O
it O
? O

idk O
. O



 O
he O
's O
never O
really O
been O
allowed O
to O
advocate O
for O
himself O
so O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
explain O
the O
importance O
to O
him O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
he O
'll O
be O
willing O
once O
he O
realizes O
how O
alarming O
his O
situation O
actually O
is O
though O
. O

I O
've O
kinda O
just O
let O
him O
be O
about O
it O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
decide O
things O
for O
him O
, O
but O
after O
this O
recent O
development O
and O
his O
doctor O
not O
knowing O
much O
about O
other O
cases O
of O
T1D O
, O
I O
was O
very O
concerned O
. O



 O
also O
, O
thank O
you O
for O
the O
kind O
words O
at O
the O
beginning O
. O

I O
really O
try O
to O
be O
good O
to O
him O
. O

we O
've O
been O
together O
for O
two O
years O
since O
the O
start O
of O
quarantine O
and O
it O
's O
both O
of O
our O
first O
relationships O
. O

we O
're O
pretty O
damn O
sure O
that O
we O
're O
it O
for O
each O
other O
but O
there O
's O
no O
use O
convincing O
other O
people O
that O
since O
we O
're O
still O
in O
hs O
lol O
