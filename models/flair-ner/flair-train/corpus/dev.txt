I O
got O
it O
two O
weeks O
ago O
, O
triple O
vaccinated O
, O
did O
a O
round O
of O
paxlovid B-DRUG
. O

The O
meds O
gave O
me O
the O
gross O
metal B-ADR
- I-ADR
mouth I-ADR
taste I-ADR
side O
effect O
and O
that O
was O
unpleasant O
, O
but O
did O
n’t O
cause O
me O
any O
flares B-ADR
or O
excess O
Crohns O
symptoms O
. O

With O
that O
said O
, O
I O
’m O
on O
humira B-DRUG
, O
my O
lungs O
never O
fully O
healed O
and O
two O
days O
after O
the O
paxlovid B-DRUG
I O
went O
into O
an O
asthmatic B-ADR
episode O
and O
now O
I O
’m O
in O
the O
hospital O
getting O
over O
poor O
oxygen O
exchange O
and O
what O
they O
say O
was O
the O
beginning O
stage O
of O
respiratory B-ADR
failure I-ADR
. O

I O
’m O
expected O
to O
make O
a O
full O
recovery O
and O
be O
out O
in O
two O
days O
. O

So O
definitely O
keep O
all O
your O
medical O
professionals O
in O
the O
loop O
and O
if O
you O
need O
to O
go O
in O
, O
do O
n’t O
wait O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
vary O
a O
lot O
between O
all O
of O
us O
. O

Hope O
you O
feel O
better O
soon O
! O


Have O
you O
actually O
taken O
an O
at O
home O
test O
for O
covid O
? O

That O
throat O
thing O
sounds O
just O
like O
what O
I O
experienced O
this O
last O
round O
of O
it O
I O
am O
just O
getting O
over O
. O

No O
fever B-ADR
tho O
. O



 O
I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
since O
2018 O
and O
never O
experienced O
any O
kind O
of O
a O
fever B-ADR
as O
a O
side O
effects O
, O
and O
I O
pretty O
much O
adapted O
to O
the O
fatigue B-ADR
( O
most O
of O
the O
time O
. O

) O
I O
hope O
it O
's O
just O
a O
cold O
and O
you O
feel O
better O
quickly O
! O


When O
I O
had O
a O
major O
exposure O
I O
was O
told O
to O
delay O
my O
next O
dose O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
until O
I O
was O
symptom O
free O
and O
negative O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
quarantine O
period O
. O

If O
I O
’d O
been O
positive O
I O
believe O
I O
would O
have O
been O
told O
to O
wait O
even O
longer O
. O


Several O
years O
ago O
Otezla B-DRUG
did O
clear O
me O
up O
after O
Humira B-DRUG
was O
not O
really O
working O
. O

But O
after O
a O
while O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
, O
and O
then O
on O
the O
next O
flare B-ADR
up O
it O
did O
help O
but O
did O
n’t O
clear O
me O
. O

Maybe O
I O
built O
up O
a O
tolerance B-ADR
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
. O



 O
I O
started O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
in O
early O
September O
and O
it O
did O
really O
improve O
my O
face O
, O
on O
which O
I O
had O
psoriasis B-ADR
from O
sunburn B-ADR
and O
itching B-ADR
for O
several O
years O
, O
as O
well O
as O
my O
scalp O
. O

But O
, O
unfortunately O
I O
also O
got O
a O
really O
bad O
flare B-ADR
up O
, O
as O
I O
stopped O
topical O
steroids B-DRUG
pretty O
suddenly O
hoping O
that O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
would O
do O
the O
trick O
. O

As O
a O
result O
i O
m O
going O
through O
a O
severe O
case O
of O
TSW O
( O
topical O
steroid O
withdrawal B-ADR
) O
, O
and O
feel B-ADR
awful I-ADR
right O
now O
. O

My O
Dr O
prescribed O
Zoryve B-DRUG
, O
so O
I O
recently O
started O
that O
and O
it O
does O
seem O
to O
help O
, O
but O
did O
really O
hurt O
in O
the O
beginning O
( O
pain B-ADR
for O
dry O
/ O
tight B-ADR
skin I-ADR
, O
very O
itchy B-ADR
/ O
stinging B-ADR
) O
. O



 O
My O
plan O
is O
to O
not O
use O
steroids B-DRUG
going O
forward O
and O
we O
’ll O
see O
how O
much O
more O
I O
can O
clear O
on O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
and O
Zoryve B-DRUG
. O

I O
also O
recently O
started O
back O
on O
light O
therapy O
. O



 O
OP O
: O
have O
you O
started O
any O
of O
the O
biologics O
you O
mentioned O
above O
? O


Congratulations O
, O
I O
miss O
the O
remission O
. O

I O
just O
was O
thrown O
back O
into O
active O
HELL O
after O
being O
in O
remission O
for O
2 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
.. O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
what O
did O
it O
for O
me O
. O

Unfortunately O
Kelsey O
Sebold O
was O
my O
insurance O
at O
the O
time.and O
they O
switched O
over O
to O
only O
company O
policy O
so O
I O
lost O
my O
insurance O
and O
have O
n't O
gotten O
back O
on O
it O
. O


I O
actually O
found O
a O
gynecological O
dermatologist O
and O
immediately O
she O
diagnosed O
me O
with O
vaginal O
crohns O
. O

I O
never O
once O
had O
a O
cyst B-ADR
or O
a O
drainage B-ADR
spot O
or O
head B-ADR
or O
anything O
, O
just O
consistent O
swelling B-ADR
. O

I O
’m O
now O
on O
humira B-DRUG
every O
week O
. O


I O
take O
remicade B-DRUG
I O
like O
it O
better O
than O
humira B-DRUG
which O
I O
tried O
out O
for O
a O
little O
over O
a O
year O
. O

I O
’ve O
had O
COVID O
and O
took O
the O
COVID O
pill O
and O
was O
fine O
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
getting O
remicade B-DRUG
now O
every O
4 O
weeks O
for O
2 O
years O
. O

It O
’s O
helped O
me O
soo O
much O
. O

I O
used O
to O
get O
flares B-ADR
that O
were O
the O
size O
of O
soft O
balls O
and O
then O
would O
never O
heal O
and O
continuously O
drain O
but O
I O
have O
n’t O
had O
one O
like O
that O
in O
years O
since O
starting O
remicade B-DRUG

Our O
healthcare O
and O
insurance O
systems O
are O
so O
fucked O
and O
it O
's O
so O
frustrating O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
itself O
has O
been O
great O
for O
me O
. O

The O
logistics O
of O
receiving O
it O
on O
time O
or O
without O
random O
insurance O
issues O
has O
been O
a O
fucking O
nightmare B-ADR
. O

And O
all O
of O
the O
runaround O
is O
simply O
so O
your O
health O
insurance O
companies O
can O
write O
off O
the O
claims O
in O
different O
ways O
. O



 O
It O
's O
awful O
and O
sorry O
you O
're O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
it O
. O


A O
few O
points O
to O
consider O
... O


 O
CostPlus O
covers O
ONLY O
generics O
. O

( O
I O
mention O
this O
specifically O
for O
all O
of O
the O
commenters O
complaining O
about O
the O
cost O
of O
biologics O
that O
are O
under O
patent O
, O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Stelara B-DRUG
) O
. O



 O
CostPlus O
does O
not O
cover O
scheduled O
drugs O
. O

This O
means O
if O
you O
take O
Xanax B-DRUG
or O
Klonopin B-DRUG
for O
anxiety B-ADR
then O
you O
wo O
n't O
get O
them O
from O
CostPlus O
, O
even O
if O
you O
use O
the O
generics O
, O
because O
they O
are O
schedule O
IV O
drugs O
. O



 O
CostPlus O
fills O
orders O
through O
a O
mail O
- O
order O
pharmacy O
. O



 O
I O
recommend O
using O
GoodRX O
instead O
. O

In O
many O
cases O
they O
are O
cheaper O
than O
CostPlus O
, O
and O
they O
work O
with O
many O
national O
pharmacy O
chains O
so O
you O
can O
pick O
up O
your O
medication O
the O
same O
day O
. O

And O
GoodRX O
DOES O
cover O
scheduled O
medications O
, O
and O
patented O
brand O
names O
( O
do O
n't O
expect O
to O
get O
a O
huge O
discount O
on O
biologics O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Stelara B-DRUG
) O
. O


While O
true O
, O
OP O
has O
been O
on O
three O
different O
TNF O
inhibitors O
( O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
Simponi B-DRUG
, O
and O
Cimzia B-DRUG
) O
, O
so O
there O
's O
probably O
no O
reason O
to O
think O
Humira B-DRUG
will O
work O
better O
. O


Day O
57 O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
( O
took O
my O
5th O
shot O
today O
actually O
) O
and O
no O
noticable O
effect O
yet O
. O

( O
Every O
other O
week O
) O
. O


Best O
of O
luck O
friend O

I O
also O
switched O
from O
humira B-DRUG
to O
stelara B-DRUG
. O

I O
only O
had O
one O
iv O
infusion O
then O
went O
to O
at O
home O
stelara B-DRUG
injections O
that O
I O
administrator O
myself O
. O

Started O
at O
8 O
week O
doses O
then O
moved O
to O
4 O
week O
doses O
. O

I O
had O
side O
affects O
with O
each O
dose O
such O
as O
really O
bad O
neck B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
stiffening O
, O
chest B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
etc O
. O

For O
about O
2.5 O
years O
. O

Eventually O
though O
my O
body O
has O
gotten O
use O
to O
the O
meds O
and O
I O
rarely O
have O
problems O
with O
the O
injections O
. O

I O
've O
been O
taking O
it O
almost O
5 O
years O
. O


Hi O
, O
I O
’m O
due O
to O
be O
starting O
on O
Adalimumab B-DRUG
soon O
as O
well O
and O
I O
think O
I O
’ve O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
same O
concerns O
. O

I O
’m O
going O
through O
the O
pre O
- O
biologic O
blood O
tests O
etc O
at O
the O
moment O
. O



 O
My O
dad O
also O
has O
Crohn O
’s O
and O
he O
’s O
been O
on O
Adalimumab B-DRUG
for O
10 O
years O
. O

He O
rates O
it O
highly O
. O

Before O
starting O
it O
he O
’d O
just O
had O
his O
second O
major O
resection O
surgery O
and O
needed O
8 O
months O
off O
work O
. O

Since O
starting O
it O
, O
he O
’s O
not O
had O
any O
more O
surgeries O
and O
generally O
feels O
like O
his O
disease O
had O
been O
in O
remission O
. O

He O
does O
have O
flare O
ups O
and O
takes O
steroids O
now O
and O
then O
. O

He O
also O
tends O
to O
get O
a O
bad O
chest B-ADR
infection I-ADR
most O
winters O
, O
never O
got O
this O
before O
the O
Adalimumab B-DRUG
so O
might O
be O
due O
to O
the O
immunosuppression O
. O

He O
managed O
to O
return O
to O
work O
full O
time O
before O
retiring O
last O
year O
at O
58 O
. O



 O
He O
is O
+ O
+ O
+ O
cautious O
in O
the O
sun O
but O
he O
’s O
ginger O
anyway O
so O
he O
’s O
always O
been O
like O
that O
lol O


 O
I O
’m O
taking O
hope O
from O
his O
experience O
tbh O
. O

He O
just O
got O
Covid O
and O
was O
absolutely O
fine O
. O

He O
’s O
very O
fit O
and O
active O
, O
travels O
a O
lot O
, O
does O
n’t O
have O
to O
live O
wrapped O
in O
cotton O
wool O
. O



 O
Hoping O
it O
works O
out O
for O
both O
of O
us O
! O


Most O
airborne O
funguses O
are O
n't O
infection B-ADR
risks O
, O
ie O
, O
they O
ca O
n't O
colonize O
your O
body O
, O
but O
some O
rare O
funguses O
can O
cause O
problems O
from O
toxins O
in O
the O
spores O
. O

Some O
people O
have O
sensitivities O
to O
environmental O
molds O
, O
which O
often O
manifest O
as O
allergy B-ADR
type O
symptoms B-ADR
. O



 O
The O
main O
fungal B-ADR
disease I-ADR
that O
has O
been O
an O
issue O
with O
anti O
- O
TNF O
drugs O
is O
histoplasmosis B-ADR
. O

" O
In O
a O
recent O
review O
, O
80 O
% O
of O
all O
 
 O
fungal B-ADR
infections I-ADR
associated O
with O
use O
of O
TNFa O
inhibitors O
were O
in O
patients O
treated O
with O
infliximab B-DRUG
, O
versus O
only O
16 O
% O
with O
etanercept B-DRUG
and O
4 O
% O
with O
 
 O
adalimumab B-DRUG
. O

" O
< O
-- O
this O
is O
saying O
only O
4 O
% O
of O
those O
people O
with O
fungal B-ADR
infections I-ADR
on O
an O
anti O
- O
TNF O
drug O
were O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Also O
, O
I O
believe O
all O
people O
in O
this O
study O
were O
also O
taking O
another O
immunosuppressant O
. O



 O
Histoplasma O
fungus O
is O
endemic O
to O
the O
soil O
in O
certain O
areas O
. O

If O
you O
search O
on O
Google O
for O
" O
histoplasmosis B-ADR
map O
" O
you O
will O
see O
maps O
showing O
where O
histoplasmosis B-ADR
is O
most O
common O
. O

So O
, O
gardening O
and O
other O
hobbies O
where O
you O
dig O
around O
in O
the O
dirt O
outside O
are O
more O
risky O
if O
you O
live O
in O
those O
areas O
. O



 O
My O
personal O
takeaway O
is O
since O
I O
'm O
relatively O
young O
and O
otherwise O
healthy O
, O
careful O
about O
hygiene O
, O
mindful O
when O
I O
get O
sick B-ADR
, O
and O
not O
on O
any O
additional O
immunosuppressive O
drugs O
( O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
imuran B-DRUG
, O
azathioprine B-DRUG
, O
etc O
) O
, O
I O
am O
likely O
to O
be O
okay O
. O



 O
Note O
: O
I O
'm O
just O
a O
lowly O
biology O
student O
and O
the O
real O
person O
to O
discuss O
this O
with O
in O
depth O
would O
be O
your O
doctor O
, O
of O
course O
. O



 O
Also O
, O
it O
's O
okay O
to O
hire O
extra O
help O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
hoarding O
problem O
! O

Considering O
doing O
this O
myself O
to O
manage O
my O
fatigue B-ADR
/ O
depression B-ADR
den O

a O

. O


Humira B-DRUG
was O
literally O
life O
changing O
for O
me O
. O

I O
started O
it O
in O
February O
2022 O
at O
a O
point O
where O
I O
would O
have O
a O
new O
spot O
pop O
up O
every O
few O
days O
. O

Since O
starting O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
I O
’ve O
had O
one O
spot O
in O
almost O
a O
year O
now O
. O

I O
wo O
n’t O
lie O
and O
say O
it O
’s O
all O
rainbows O
and O
unicorns O
as O
the O
injections O
can O
sometimes O
be O
uncomfortable O
but O
I O
personally O
will O
gladly O
trade O
20 O
- O
30 O
seconds O
of O
discomfort B-ADR
to O
take O
the O
weekly O
injection O
over O
the O
hellish O
pain B-ADR
of O
an O
HS O
outbreak O
any O
day O
. O


Fellow O
needle O
phobic O
person O
. O

Really O
empathize O
. O



 O
I O
've O
done O
Humira B-DRUG
3 O
times O
- O
have O
had O
someone O
help O
do O
the O
actual O
injection O
for O
me O
. O

Will O
start O
doing O
it O
myself O
as O
I O
get O
more O
comfortable O
. O



 O
It O
can O
help O
to O
distract O
your O
senses O
– O
  O
I O
put O
on O
music O
, O
perhaps O
spritzing O
perfume O
and O
focusing O
on O
scent O
could O
help O
too O
. O



 O
I O
found O
a O
big O
difference O
between O
letting O
it O
" O
warm O
up O
" O
to O
room O
temp O
for O
1 O
hr O
and O
leaving O
it O
out O
for O
3 O
+ O
hours O
. O

I O
still O
felt O
a O
cold B-ADR
sensation I-ADR
at O
1 O
hr O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
that O
. O



 O
If O
it O
's O
useful O
to O
know O
– O
  O
the O
needle O
itself O
is O
much O
smaller O
than O
your O
average O
needle O
for O
a O
flu O
vaccine O
, O
etc O
. O


Why O
did O
I O
have O
to O
end O
up O
with O
one O
of O
the O
most O
disgusting O
and O
unbearable O
skin O
conditions O
? O

I O
ca O
n’t O
wear O
certain O
clothes O
, O
let O
alone O
white O
wins O
because O
pus O
and O
blood O
might O
seep O
through O
, O
I O
have O
a O
fear O
of O
being O
intimate O
with O
my O
partner O
, O
this O
shit O
causes O
a O
bad O
smell O
, O
and O
it O
’s O
not O
even O
guaranteed O
surgery O
will O
make O
it O
go O
away O
. O

I O
’m O
on O
humira B-DRUG
injections O
but O
they O
only O
do O
so O
much O
for O
me O
. O


Insurance O
in O
America O
is O
so O
idiotic O
it O
hurts O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
has O
a O
very O
generous O
program O
to O
help O
cover O
the O
insurance O
gap O
. O

When O
I O
had O
a O
high O
deductible O
plan O
with O
crap O
coverage O
, O
Humira B-DRUG
closed O
the O
gap O
. O

Maybe O
switching O
could O
be O
worthwhile O
? O

Alternatively O
, O
maybe O
Enbrel B-DRUG
could O
chip O
in O
more O
? O

Also O
, O
and O
this O
is O
maybe O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
stretch O
, O
could O
your O
insurance O
help O
out O
some O
? O

In O
theory O
, O
they O
should O
actually O
be O
negotiating O
drug O
prices O
. O

We O
all O
know O
pharma O
companies O
jack O
up O
prices O
in O
order O
to O
gouge O
insurance O
, O
and O
it O
’s O
all O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
scam O
. O

Maybe O
they O
could O
help O
you O
? O


I O
’ll O
be O
getting O
off O
of O
them O
soon O
and O
switching O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
I O
’m O
pretty O
sure O
I O
can O
take O
shrooms O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
I O
’m O
not O
positive O

Thanks O
for O
your O
response O
, O
did O
you O
try O
Humira B-DRUG
previously O
also O
? O

What O
was O
your O
experience O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
? O


Started O
with O
one O
finger O
, O
then O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
later O
a O
foot O
. O

Another O
month O
and O
another O
finger O
. O



 O
Then O
all O
hell O
broke O
loose O
and O
in O
short O
order O
I O
got O
swelling B-ADR
and O
pain B-ADR
in O
three O
more O
fingers O
, O
the O
other O
foot O
and O
both O
knees O
. O



 O
Then O
it O
stabilised O
and O
now O
when O
I O
started O
humira B-DRUG
the O
other O
day O
I O
hope O
to O
become O
more O
or O
less O
fully O
functional O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
. O


I O
’m O
more O
fatigued B-ADR
and O
bruise B-ADR
easily O
so O
far O
but O
I O
’m O
taking O
doxy B-DRUG
with O
humira B-DRUG
and O
I O
have O
n’t O
flared B-ADR

thank O
you O
for O
sharing O
, O
i O
am O
sending O
you O
healing O
energy O
. O

my O
rheumatologist O
also O
wants O
me O
to O
start O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
i O
’m O
super O
nervous O
as O
well O

I O
'm O
generally O
pain B-ADR
free O
. O

  O
In O
order O
of O
what O
has O
reduced O
my O
inflammation B-ADR
the O
most O
: O
humira B-DRUG
, O
limiting O
starch O
and O
sugar O
intake O
, O
strength O
training O
and O
mobility O
work O
, O
enough O
sleep O
, O
occasionally O
ibuprofen B-DRUG
( O
needed O
rarely O
now O
, O
was O
living O
on O
it O
before O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
  O
but O
it O
can O
be O
a O
hard O
on O
your O
stomach O
and O
did O
n't O
work O
as O
well O
alone O
) O
. O



 O
I O
remember O
the O
bad O
flares B-ADR
and O
when O
I O
could O
barely O
move O
before O
understanding O
and O
treating O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
me O
. O

  O
It O
was O
awful O
. O

  O
The O
right O
treatment(s O
) O
  O
( O
for O
you O
) O
and O
lifestyle O
changes O
can O
make O
all O
the O
difference O
. O


Mine O
was O
absolutely O
devastating O
. O

  O
Knees O
, O
hips O
, O
back O
, O
  O
elbows O
, O
shoulders O
, O
neck O
. O

  O
It O
destroyed O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
long O
before O
the O
vomiting B-ADR
/ O
diarrhea B-ADR
did O
. O

  O
I O
've O
been O
in O
treatment O
for O
years O
now O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
still O
dealing O
with O
the O
after O
effects O
. O

  O
To O
this O
day O
, O
I O
'm O
still O
more O
afraid O
of O
the O
arthritis B-ADR
than O
the O
gut B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O



 O
With O
that O
said O
, O
mine O
responded O
beautifully O
to O
biologics O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
, O
Stelara B-DRUG
, O
Remicade B-DRUG
all O
turned O
it O
off O
like O
turning O
off O
a O
light O
. O

  O
In O
fact O
, O
when O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Remicade B-DRUG
failed O
, O
returning O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
was O
my O
first O
symptom O
. O


I O
’m O
really O
really O
hoping O
this O
works O
, O
over O
the O
past O
year O
I O
’ve O
failed O
Inflectra B-DRUG
, O
failed O
Entyvio B-DRUG
, O
and O
my O
doctors O
said O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
other O
treatments O
are O
hard O
to O
get O
covered O
if O
you O
’re O
under O
18 O
. O

This O
flare B-ADR
has O
taken O
away O
so O
much O
from O
me O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
’ve O
lost O
the O
past O
year O
of O
my O
life O
. O

Fingers O
crossed O
it O
comes O
to O
an O
end O
soon O
! O


You O
're O
not O
alone O
. O

I O
got O
my O
first O
one O
around O
16 O
. O

I O
'm O
37 O
now O
. O

I O
've O
been O
suffering O
non O
stop O
since O
December O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
the O
humira B-DRUG
shot O
a O
little O
before O
covid O
hit O
. O

It O
worked O
but O
I O
lost O
coverage O
. O

Been O
trying O
to O
get O
back O
on O
insurance O
ever O
since O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
get O
any O
easier O
the O
older O
I O
get O
. O

Idk O
how O
this O
was O
suppose O
to O
help O
but O
ever O
since O
I O
've O
seen O
a O
dermatologist O
, O
it O
's O
gave O
me O
more O
motivation O
knowing O
that O
someone O
finally O
understood O
what O
I O
was O
going O
through O
. O

The O
shots O
helped O
a O
lot O
too O
. O

The O
most O
pain B-ADR
free O
three O
months O
of O
my O
life O
. O

Keep O
trying O
and O
never O
give O
up O
. O

This O
disease O
has O
robbed O
me O
of O
many O
things O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
let O
it O
take O
anymore O
. O

You O
should O
n't O
either O
. O

If O
you O
ever O
need O
to O
vent O
about O
this O
disease O
feel O
free O
to O
dm O
. O

Fuck O
HS O

trust O
me O
when O
i O
tell O
you O
i O
was O
the O
exact O
same O
way O
. O

i O
used O
to O
cancel O
plans O
and O
make O
up O
reasons O
why O
i O
could O
n't O
go O
but O
the O
real O
reason O
was O
i O
was O
scared O
of O
leaving O
my O
access O
to O
a O
toilet O
— O
and O
that O
being O
my O
toilet O
. O



 O
humira B-DRUG
truly O
did O
wonders O
for O
me O
, O
and O
i O
hope O
the O
same O
for O
you O
! O



 O
i O
wish O
you O
well O
on O
this O
very O
rewarding O
journey O
. O

and O
remember O
, O
if O
humira B-DRUG
does O
n't O
work O
out O
, O
the O
drug O
failed O
you O
— O
not O
the O
other O
way O
around O
. O


I O
am O
the O
exact O
same O
as O
this O
. O

Been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
3 O
months O
now O
and O
I O
've O
made O
0 O
changes O
to O
my O
lifestyle O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
'd O
almost O
argue O
I O
've O
actually O
been O
harder O
on O
my O
body O
since O
I O
started O
it O
because O
the O
drug O
essentially O
gave O
me O
my O
life O
back O
so O
I O
've O
been O
taking O
advantage O
of O
that O
. O

I O
was O
in O
significant O
pain B-ADR
so O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
hard O
decision O
at O
all O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
is O
the O
only O
biologic O
I O
've O
been O
on O
. O

I O
've O
been O
on O
it O
for O
4 O
months O
and O
have O
seen O
no O
difference O
in O
my O
UC O
. O

I O
've O
seen O
a O
lot O
of O
similar O
stories O
from O
other O
users O
on O
that O
particular O
drug O
. O

My O
doctor O
is O
putting O
me O
on O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
next O
. O


Or O
maybe O
a O
referral O
to O
a O
derm O
that O
could O
then O
refer O
to O
a O
specialist O
? O

From O
my O
experience O
with O
the O
specialists O
and O
derms O
I O
’ve O
seen O
, O
there O
is O
n’t O
much O
they O
’ve O
offered O
other O
than O
antibiotics O
/ O

I O
am O
on O
another O
TNF O
inhibitor O
( O
Simponi B-DRUG
, O
which O
I O
started O
after O
Humira B-DRUG
stated O
to O
fail O
for O
me O
) O
and O
I O
was O
told O
to O
delay O
my O
next O
dose O
7 O
to O
10 O
days O
( O
I O
was O
due O
the O
day O
after O
I O
tested O
positive O

Before O
Crohn O
I O
was O
healthy O

Never O
took O
more O

either O

 O
I O
was O
on O
mesalasine O

4 O
years O

new O
exams O

it O
was O

working O
enough O

I O
was O
ok O

I O
still O

I O
could O
eat O
just O
a O
very O
small O
amount O
of O
gluten O
, O
I O
thought O
that O
was O
my O
life O
now O
. O


Then O
between O
stopping O
it O
and O
starting O
Hyrimoz B-DRUG
( O
Humira B-DRUG
) O
I O
developped O
an O
abcess B-ADR
in O
my O
intestines O
. O

I O
could O
have O
died O
. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
hospital O
for O
2 O
weeks O
with O
39 O
° O
C O
( O
102 O
° O
F O
) O
of O
fever B-ADR
, O
infusion O
of O
antibiotics O
and O
then O
3 O
more O
months O
of O
antibiotics O
. O

Almost O
got O
surgery O
. O



 O
It O
wrecked O
me O
. O

Both O
physically O
and O
mentally O
. O

It O
worried O
my O
loved O
ones O
too O
. O



 O
Compared O
to O
that O
, O
two O
self O
injections O
a O
month O
does O
n't O
seem O
so O
big O
. O



 O
I O
know O
it O
's O
scary O
but O
it O
really O
did O
n't O
change O
my O
life O
. O

I O
have O
absolutely O
zero O
side O
effects O
. O

I O
'm O
just O
healthier O
and O
free O
to O
eat O
almost O
normally O
. O


Honestly O
I O
'm O
doin O
ok O
atm O
, O
there O
was O
a O
time O
I O
went O
back O
to O
work O
when O
I O
started O
feeling O
good O
, O
almost O
normal O
life O
. O

However O
stopping O
MTX O
really O
affected O
RINVOQ B-DRUG
's O
efficacy O
( O
in O
my O
case O
) O
and O
went O
into O
plateau O
. O

Symptoms O
were O
still O
manageable O
, O
  O
till O
I O
developed O
more O
symptoms O
( O
enthesopathy B-ADR
different O
part O
of O
the O
body O
including O
costochondritis B-ADR
) O
. O

Tried O
to O
convince O
my O
rheumy O
that O
I O
'm O
not O
responding O
, O
he O
kept O
dismissing O
me O
. O



 O
Finally O
managed O
switching O
to O
humira B-DRUG
( O
private O
funding O
) O
4/5th O
injection O
. O

I O
felt O
the O
difference O
from O
day O
2 O
, O
but O
it O
weans O
off O
day O
6/7 O
. O


I O
'd O
still O
suggest O
( O
not O
medical O
advice O
) O
augmenting O
RINVOQ B-DRUG
with O
MTX O
7.5- O
10 O
mg O
when O
ur O
LFT O
goes O
back O
to O
normal O
. O

I O
heard O
xeljanz B-DRUG
is O
another O
good O
oral O
option O
. O


Did O
yr O
doc O
suggest O
any O
other O
options O
? O



 O
All O
the O
best O

Well O
look O
at O
all O
the O
pump O
and O
dumps O
over O
2021 O
.... O
They O
are O
all O
medical O
..... O
You O
will O
see O
BIOR O
aka O
prog O
move O
up O
... O
It O
has O
good O
solid O
foundation O
and O
the O
medicine O
is O
more O
advanced O
.... O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
it O
's O
biggest O
competition O
for O
GI O
related O
conditions O
but O
has O
this O
an O
efficacy O
of O
about O
65 O
- O
80 O
% O
with O
alot O
of O
unneeded O
symptoms O
.. O
m O
most O
medicated O
therapies O
are O
shotgun O
therapies O
with O
terrible O
side O
effects O
..... O
This O
delivery O
system O
is O
a O
game O
changer O
..... O
If O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
and O
forget O
on O
this O
stock O
.... O
I O
would O
say O
do O
it O
because O
momentum O
on O
this O
will O
take O
off O
once O
it O
's O
used O
exclusively O
by O
GI O
docs O
.... O
I O
am O
a O
Physician O
Assistant O
student O
about O

I O
been O
in O
the O
medical O
field O
for O
over O
15 O
yrs O
and O
actually O
have O
a O
GI O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
current O

will O
not O

Rock O
has O
alot O
of O
juice O
and O
ammo O
to O
use O
on O
the O

they O
also O
like O
to O
drop O
a O

buy O
it O
for O
cheap O
and O
run O
the O

up O

it O
again O
.... O
Just O
be O

and O
obviously O
holding O

you O
save O
more O
in O
the O
long O

..... O
Just O
personal O
opinion O
but O
I O
can O
say O
that O
it O
's O
a O
game O
changer O
in O
GI O
medicine O
..... O

Is O
a O
15 O
% O
discount O
affordable O
to O
you O
for O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
? O

If O
not O
, O
see O
if O
you O
can O
get O
more O
. O

When O
I O
had O
insurance O
that O
left O
gaps O
in O
my O
drug O
coverage O
and O
struggled O
to O
afford O
the O
medication O
, O
Humira B-DRUG
gave O
me O
a O
card O
that O
always O
brought O
the O
medication O
down O
to O
$ O
5 O
per O
refill O
. O


I O
just O
turned O
25 O
, O
taltz B-DRUG
was O
the O
fifth O
biologic O
I O
have O
been O
on O
, O
and O
currently O
am O
still O
on O
! O

Started O
it O
last O
spring O
. O

It O
has O
managed O
to O
keep O
me O
from O
getting O
worse O
. O

I O
still O
hurt B-ADR
but O
wayyyyy O
less O
than O
I O
did O
when O
I O
was O
on O
the O
other O
4 O
. O

I O
was O
first O
on O
humira B-DRUG
, O
then O
enbrel B-DRUG
, O
then O
cimzia B-DRUG
, O
and O
then O
orencia B-DRUG
before O
taltz B-DRUG
. O

I O
started O
biological O
probably O
3 O
? O

Years O
ago O
, O
and O
finally O
found O
the O
one O
to O
help O
prevent O
further O
joint B-ADR
destruction I-ADR
. O

I O
hope O
it O
works O
for O
you O
! O


That O
's O
good O
... O

Sounds O
like O
u O
prefer O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
over O
humira B-DRUG
? O


Wat O
makes O
different O
, O
did O
u O
have O
better O
results O
with O
xeljanz B-DRUG
? O


I O
'm O
on O
humira B-DRUG
atm O
, O
tried O
RINVOQ B-DRUG
before O
and O
I O
think O
I O
wanna O
go O
back O
to O
it O
. O

I O
have O
another O
condition O
but O
they O
all O
go O
under O
the O
same O
treatment O

My O
first O
bought O
with O
arthritis B-ADR
was O
in O
my O
hips O
. O

  O
I O
had O
taken O
dance O
all O
my O
life O
and O
had O
stopped O
teaching O
just O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
prior O
. O

  O
I O
was O
in O
my O
mid O
to O
late O
20s O
and O
should O
n't O
have O
had O
to O
roll O
out O
of O
bed O
because O
scooting O
was O
impossible O
, O
but O
there O
I O
was O
. O

  O
This O
was O
before O
biologics O
. O



 O
That O
got O
better O
as O
I O
got O
my O
disease O
under O
control O
but O
the O
minimal O
overall O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
( O
mostly O
achy B-ADR
feelings I-ADR
in O
my O
joints O
) O
went O
away O
after O
I O
got O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Fast O
forward O
to O
being O
in O
Entyvio B-DRUG
and O
the O
arthritis B-ADR
got O
worse O
. O

  O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
Entyvio B-DRUG
helps O
with O
joint O
pain B-ADR
as O
it O
is O
specifically O
for O
Crohn O
's O
and O
UC O
whereas O
other O
bios O
we O
take O
are O
also O
used O
for O
Rheumatoid B-ADR
Arthritis I-ADR
. O


I O
believe O
it O
’s O
antibodies O
as O
well O
. O

All O
this O
started O
to O
happened O
when O
they O
gave O
me O
a O
higher O
doze O
. O

But O
my O
doctors O
have O
a O
plan O
and O
one O
of O
the O
plans O
is O
to O
move O
on O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Thanks O
for O
responding O
! O


I O
quit O
self O
- O
employment O
and O
got O
a O
government O
job O
with O
the O
best O
insurance O
specifically O
to O
pay O
for O
my O
humira B-DRUG
, O
$ O
20 O
a O
month O
! O


I O
was O
on O
Imuran B-DRUG
for O
quite O
a O
while O
and O
am O
now O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
have O
n't O
had O
to O
have O
it O
taken O
out O
yet O
. O



 O
I O
will O
say O
that O
with O
the O
location O
of O
your O
Crohn O
's O
there O
will O
be O
many O
fun O
games O
of O
" O
Is O
it O
appendicitis B-ADR
or O
is O
it O
Crohn O
's O
? O

" O
as O
the O
pain B-ADR
is O
usually O
located O
in O
the O
same O
area O
. O



 O
A O
way O
I O
've O
cut O
down O
on O
my O
unnecessary O
ER O
visits O
with O
this O
frustrating O
guessing O
game O
is O
that O
I O
try O
the O
rebound O
pain B-ADR
test O
, O
where O
theoretically O
if O
it O
's O
appendicitis B-ADR
, O
when O
you O
push O
down O
where O
the O
pain B-ADR
is O
, O
it O
will O
hurt O
more O
when O
you O
stop O
pushing O
than O
when O
you O
were O
applying O
force O
. O

It O
's O
always O
hurt O
more O
when O
I O
pushed O
down O
than O
let O
go O
, O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
yet O
had O
appendicitis B-ADR
so O
so O
far O
the O
system O
is O
working O
. O

😆 O

Wow O
, O
this O
is O
an O
old O
one O
! O



 O
Best O
I O
can O
say O
is O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
person O
, O
and O
that O
it O
will O
work O
until O
it O
does O
n't O
. O

I O
got O
over O
a O
decade O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
before O
moving O
off O
to O
new O
medication O
. O

I O
would O
still O
say O
that O
my O
symptoms O
are O
managed O
and O
I O
can O
for O
the O
most O
part O
live O
a O
normal O
life O
. O


Shortly O
after O
being O
diagnosed O
I O
was O
on O
remicade B-DRUG
for O
a O
few O
years O
before O
my O
body O
created O
antibodies O
to O
it O
and O
have O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
since O
. O

Personally O
humira B-DRUG
is O
alot O
more O
convenient O
and O
I O
enjoy O
it O
alot O
more O
. O


My O
first O
dose O
Humira B-DRUG
literally O
sent O
a O
nurse O
to O
my O
house O
to O
help O
out O
. O

They O
really O
went O
to O
pains O
to O
make O
sure O
I O
was O
supported O
. O

Might O
be O
last O
minute O
, O
but O
you O
could O
see O
if O
that O
can O
be O
arranged O
. O


Do O
you O
think O
its O
okay O
to O
keep O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
shots O
if O
I O
have O
a O
viral B-ADR
infection I-ADR
? O

I O
can O
see O
my O
gp O
on O
monday O
. O

My O
next O
injection O
is O
this O
friday O
. O

Because O
my O
rheumatologist O
said O
that O
humira B-DRUG
can O
lower O
the O
immune O
system O
to O
fight O
infections B-ADR
. O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
could O
make O
it O
worse O
? O

Thank O
you O
. O


I O
would O
recommend O
it O
. O

I O
have O
to O
have O
regular O
blood O
test O
because O
I O
'm O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
at O
my O
last O
check O
I O
was O
slightly O
anemic B-ADR
and O
slightly O
malnourished B-ADR

Have O
a O
look O
on O
Crohns O
and O
Colitis B-ADR
UK- O
they O
have O
good O
summaries O
of O
all O
the O
treatment O
options O
including O
the O
different O
biologicals O
. O

In O
UK O
I O
failed O
mezavant B-DRUG
, O
azathioprine B-DRUG
, O
budesonide B-DRUG
and O
multiple O
pred B-DRUG
courses O
then O
tried O
my O
first O
biological O
( O
adalimumab B-DRUG
) O
. O

Adalimimab B-DRUG
did O
n't O
work O
either O
but O
a O
different O
biological O
( O
vedolizumab B-DRUG
) O
finally O
did O
. O

A O
large O
number O
of O
people O
on O
here O
are O
on O
different O
biologicals O
and O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
posts O
discussing O
them O
. O


At O
my O
worst O
, O
everything O
was O
swollen O
and O
hurt O
, O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
could O
n’t O
do O
anything O
for O
myself O
and O
all O
of O
the O
things O
I O
loved O
about O
life O
were O
taken O
from O
me O
. O

Plaquenil B-DRUG
helped O
get O
the O
swelling B-ADR
down O
. O

Methotrexate B-DRUG
helped O
get O
the O
pain B-ADR
under O
control O
some O
of O
the O
time O
. O

3 O
months O
into O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
I O
’m O
feeling O
creative O
again O
, O
getting O
caught O
up O
on O
chores O
, O
and O
feel O
like O
an O
actual O
human O
for O
7 O
- O
10 O
days O
between O
doses O
. O


I O
tried O
humira B-DRUG
first O
and O
it O
stopped B-ADR
workin I-ADR
at O
about O
the O
5 O

Meslamine B-DRUG
did O
n’t O
work O
at O
all O
for O
me O
. O

I O
’m O
now O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
but O
not O
fully O
remission O
, O
still O
have O
urgency B-ADR
and O
loose B-ADR
stools I-ADR
sometimes O
and O
pain B-ADR
. O

Sometimes O
I O
have O
to O
take O
prednisone B-DRUG
again O
if O
I O
see O
any O
blood O
but O
I O
’m O
not O
sure O
what O
to O
try O
next O
, O
pretty O
scared O
of O
changing O
and O
it O
getting O
even O
worse O
. O


Best O
advice O
i O
ve O
ever O
gotten O
was O
from O
my O
friend O
who O
' O
you O
need O
to O
be O
your O
own O
doctor O
' O
we O
both O
have O
science O
backgrounds O
..... O
Fast O
forward O
1 O
year O
and O
my O
gastro O
doctor O
said O
i O
do O
nt O
have O
chrons O
anymore O
and O
it O
was O
probably O
' O
misdiagnosed O
' O
. O


Imo O
crohns O
is O
like O
covid O
, O
you O
have O
to O
throw O
the O
kitchen O
sink O
at O
( O
lol O
the O
rage B-ADR
of O
the O
readers O
just O
intensified O
) O

For O
me O
it O
was O
an O
intense O
Nutrional O
, O
physical O
and O
mental O
protocol O
. O


Basically O
every O
thing O
i O
did O
was O
not O
recommend O
to O
by O
any O
of O
my O
3 O
gastro O
doctors O
. O


I O
agree O
with O
you O
OP O
most O
people O
talk O
out O
they O
're O
ass O
, O
but O
i O
learnt O
alot O
/ O
most O
doctors O
also O
do O
to O
and O
prescribe O
shit O
that O
does O
n't O
need O
to O
be O
prescribed O
. O


Functional O
medicine O
is O
the O
way O
forward O
with O
crohns O
. O

Not O
that O
fucking O
$ O
4,000 O
humira B-DRUG
i O
wasted O
my O
money O
on O
after O
my O
doctor O
convinced O
me O
to O
buy O
it O
. O

What O
fucking O
scam O
.... O
To O
be O
fair O
to O
you O
guys O
here O
initially O
they O
said O
it O
was O
mild O
crohns O
... O
I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
what O
it O
's O
like O
having O
it O
severe O
. O


I O
’m O
on O
Hulio B-DRUG
which O
is O
the O
same O
as O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

It O
’s O
supposed O
to O
work O
, O
but O
does O
n’t O
seem O
to O
be O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
uveitis B-ADR
. O

It O
’s O
fixed O
all O
my O
other O
symptoms O
though O
. O

So O
that O
’s O
an O
ongoing O
challenge O
we O
have O
to O
navigate O
. O



 O
Glad O
it O
’s O
working O
for O
you O
! O


Not O
at O
all O
. O

Have O
n’t O
caught O
a O
flu O
in O
years O
and O
no O
COVID O
either O
. O



 O
The O
medications O
are O
totally O
worth O
it O
. O

My O
liver O
labs O
were O
elevated O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
but O
I O
did O
great O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
now O
on O
Cellcept B-DRUG

hello O
, O
i O
’ve O
been O
taking O
humira B-DRUG
for O
a O
little O
while O
but O
may O
have O
to O
switch O
to O
stelara B-DRUG
… O
just O
a O
question O
. O

did O
you O
just O
have O
these O
side O
effects O
after O
your O
first O
infusion O
or O
after O
every O
infusion O
? O


I O
had O
similar O
GI B-ADR
issues I-ADR
for O
many O
years O
, O
but O
my O
GI O
doc O
was O
n't O
able O
to O
pinpoint O
a O
cause O
within O
the O
testing O
I O
was O
willing O
to O
do O
( O
everything O
except O
a O
colonoscopy O
) O
. O

I O
learned O
to O
live O
with O
it O
until O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
AS O
last O
year O
. O

I O
noticed O
that O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
I O
was O
put O
on O
was O
also O
improving O
the O
GI B-ADR
issues I-ADR
. O

Humira B-DRUG
only O
worked O
for O
a O
little O
while O
before O
I O
was O
switched O
to O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
which O
did O
nothing O
for O
my O
joints O
and O
allowed O
the O
GI B-ADR
problems I-ADR
to O
return O
. O

I O
told O
my O
rheum O
about O
the O
digestive B-ADR
issues I-ADR
and O
how O
Humira B-DRUG
helped O
, O
so O
she O
put O
me O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
and O
said O
I O
probably O
have O
an O
IBD B-ADR
. O

It O
's O
apparently O
pretty O
common O
to O
have O
some O
sort O
of O
colitis B-ADR
or O
crohns O
disease O
in O
addition O
to O
AS O
. O

Thank O
goodness O
some O
of O
the O
meds O
treat O
both O
. O


This O
happened O
to O
me O
2 O
months O
in O
as O
well O
! O

There O
is O
no O
way O
to O
be O
certain O
but O
based O
on O
all O
the O
things O
I O
tried O
to O
figure O
it O
out O
, O
I O
believe O
it O
caused O
me O
to O
become O
more O
sensitive O
to O
soaps O
and O
detergents O
. O

I O
first O
tried O
different O
detergents O
( O
hypoallergenics O
, O
more O
natural O
or O
plant O
based O
, O
and O
name O
brand O
traditional O
detergents O
) O
- O
the O
detergent O
itself O
did O
n’t O
seem O
to O
help O
. O

However O
, O
my O
hives B-ADR
stopped O
altogether O
after O
I O
quit O
using O
liquid O
fabric O
softener O
( O
I O
still O
use O
dryer O
sheets O
tho O
) O
and O
set O
the O
washer O
to O
do O
two O
rinse O
cycles O
. O

My O
rheumatologist O
said O
it O
is O
n’t O
really O
possible O
to O
determine O
if O
this O
is O
medically O
valid O
or O
why O
it O
happens O
but O
that O
if O
it O
works O
just O
roll O
with O
it O
. O

Maybe O
this O
wo O
n’t O
work O
for O
you O
but O
since O
it O
is O
something O
east O
to O
try O
maybe O
give O
it O
a O
shot O
and O
see O
! O

I O
know O
it O
is O
frustrating O
to O
have O
a O
major O
medical O
challenge O
resolved O
so O
miraculously O
and O
then O
wind O
up O
with O
a O
new O
annoying O
event O
in O
exchange O
. O

You O
’ll O
probably O
run O
into O
a O
few O
more O
hiccups O
as O
you O
settle O
into O
humira B-DRUG
as O
most O
of O
us O
do O
but O
I O
hope O
it O
works O
out O
for O
you O
so O
you O
can O
enjoy O
feeling O
healthier O
and O
happier O
! O

Good O
luck O
! O


From O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Taltz B-DRUG
yes O
so O
I O
would O
n't O
be O
surprised O
if O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
has O
the O
same O
side O
effects O

Ah O
, O
someone O
gets O
it O
. O

It O
’s O
important O
that O
someone O
acquires O
the O
company O
and O
can O
come O
to O
market O
by O
the O
time O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
patent O
expires O
. O

This O
will O
give O
that O
company O
a O
huge O
advantage O
for O
not O
only O
a O
Humira B-DRUG
variant O
, O
but O
many O
other O
drugs O
as O
the O
delivery O
platform O
is O
used O
. O


Hi O
sorry O
for O
reviving O
this O
10 O
year O
old O
thread O
I O
have O
been O
recently O
diagnosed O
with O
crohns O
and O
was O
just O
curious O
with O
the O
long O
term O
treatments O
. O

Are O
you O
still O
on O
humira B-DRUG
or O
how O
do O
you O
manage O
it O
now O
? O

I O
have O
it O
fairly O
mild O
but O
am O
starting O
remicade B-DRUG
and O
have O
heard O
these O
medicines O
can O
sometimes O
only O
work O
a O
few O
years O
at O
a O
time O
. O

Thanks O
for O
replying O
if O
you O
see O
this O
! O


How O
Kong O
you O
used O
them O
? O

İts O
first O
i O
read O
montlu O
usage O
of O
humira B-DRUG
. O

How O
was O
your O
cep O
levels O
? O


Oh O
wow O
! O

Omg O
remission O
. O

That O
’s O
amazing O
! O

Cannabis B-DRUG
makes O
me O
sick B-ADR
, O
but O
I O
’ll O
ask O
my O
doctor O
about O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Thank O
you O
! O


No O
worries O
, O
call O
your O
insurance O
company O
and O
ask O
, O
the O
phone O
number O
is O
usually O
on O
the O
insurance O
card O
. O

  O
It O
is O
statistically O
likely O
that O
your O
monthly O
cost O
will O
be O
$ O
5-$60 O
/ O
month O
. O

  O
Abbvie O
has O
made O
billions O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
have O
been O
granting O
discounts O
to O
insurance O
companies O
for O
years O
. O

  O
Abbvie O
has O
a O
reduced O
copay O
program O
you O
can O
apply O
to O
if O
your O
insurance O
company O
is O
ridiculous O
. O



 O
Also O
ask O
the O
doctor(s O
) O
that O
prescribed O
Humira B-DRUG
who O
you O
should O
call O
because O
you O
heard O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
expensive O
. O



 O
I O
think O
the O
MSRP O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
like O
$ O
10,000 O
+ O
per O
month O
on O
paper O
, O
but O
most O
patients O
pay O
$ O
5‐$60 O
/ O
month O
. O

  O
Good O
luck O
and O
hopefully O
soon O
your O
symptoms B-ADR
will O
be O
under O
control O
. O


I O
have O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
over O
3 O
years O
. O

I O
have O
been O
sick B-ADR
less O
while O
on O
it O
. O

I O
work O
in O
a O
bar O
and O
still O
did O
n't O
catch O
Covid O
even O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
am O
someone O
who O
has O
always O
been O
a O
hand O
washer O
and O
careful O
anyhow O
, O
but O
definitely O
in O
a O
high O
risk O
work O
place.and O
been O
fine O
. O


I O
obviously O
ca O
n’t O
speak O
for O
anyone O
else O
. O

But O
I O
have O
Ulcerative B-ADR
Colitis I-ADR
and O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
the O
most O
effective O
drug O
I O
’ve O
used O
so O
far O
- O
and O
I O
’ve O
experienced O
zero O
side O
effects O
. O

Apart O
from O
extreme O
fatigue B-ADR
after O
the O
first O
couple O
loading O
doses O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
and O
it O
’s O
still O
going O
great O
, O
yet O
to O
experience O
any O
side O
effects O
. O

Hopefully O
it O
stays O
this O
way O
! O

! O


Thanks O
for O
the O
perspective O
. O

I O
definitely O
am O
not O
trying O
to O
get O
off O
Humira B-DRUG
because O
it O
’s O
not O
working O
for O
me O
yet O
. O

Really O
it O
’s O
the O
opposite O
- O
if O
I O
do O
n’t O
have O
antibodies O
but O
the O
dosage O
is O
wrong O
, O
I O
just O
want O
to O
correct O
that O
so O
I O
can O
get O
some O
relief O
out O
of O
it O
instead O
of O
only O
having O
the O
negative O
side O
effects O
. O

I O
’m O
probably O
going O
to O
do O
what O
you O
mentioned O
and O
search O
for O
a O
second O
opinion O
because O
if O
it O
’s O
a O
long O
wait O
, O
I O
’ll O
probably O
be O
needing O
to O
do O
the O
testing O
that O
they O
’ll O
likely O
want O
anyway O
. O



 O
It O
’s O
all O
just O
a O
bit O
confusing O
because O
I O
’ve O
heard O
of O
people O
who O
instantly O
felt O
completely O
better O
and O
who O
entered O
symptomatic O
remission O
between O
1 O
- O
3 O
months O
after O
slowly O
getting O
better O
but O
have O
yet O
to O
hear O
of O
people O
taking O
more O
than O
3 O
months O
to O
feel O
any O
different O
but O
still O
have O
success O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O

I O
want O
to O
give O
it O
any O
chance O
possible O
but O
it O
’s O
just O
not O
really O
clear O
whether O
there O
even O
* O
is O
* O
a O
chance O
based O
on O
my O
lack O
of O
any O
response O
to O
the O
drug O
aside O
from O
feeling O
worse O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
ways O
. O

With O
that O
said O
it O
’s O
helpful O
to O
know O
that O
you O
’ve O
had O
results O
eventually O
. O

Did O
you O
ever O
enter O
remission O
, O
though O
? O


Thank O
you O
! O

When O
failing O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
they O
switched O
me O
right O
away O
. O

Unfortunately O
with O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
I O
had O
to O
give O
it O
3 O
months O
on O
fortnightly O
injections O
and O
then O
a O
month O
on O
weekly O
injections O
to O
then O
be O
considered O
for O
Zeposia B-DRUG
. O



 O
Zeposia B-DRUG
took O
around O
4 O
weeks O
for O
me O
to O
have O
some O
symptom O
relief O
. O

Now O
at O
week O
7 O
I O
believe O
and O
feeling O
pretty O
good O
. O



 O
No O
pain B-ADR
but O
still O
some O
urgency O
so O
I O
need O
to O
be O
mindful O
. O


Thanks O
! O

Final O
question O
because O
I O
'm O
having O
a O
similar O
case O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Working O
somewhat O
but O
not O
controlling O
pain B-ADR
enough O
. O



 O
Are O
you O
taking O
MTX B-DRUG
or O
another O
DMARD O
with O
remicade B-DRUG
? O

Would O
you O
say O
you O
are O
in O
remission O
now O
? O


I O
ve O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
around O
2 O
years O
and O
it O
does O
an O
okay O
job O
at O
preventing O
flare B-ADR
ups I-ADR
. O

But O
the O
needles O
are O
very O
painful B-ADR
and O
can O
be O
super O
inconsistent O

I O
’ve O
been O
using O
it O
on O
and O
off O
for O
the O
pain B-ADR
whilst O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
months O
now O
. O


Been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
years O
and O
still O
scuba O
dive O
and O
snorkel O
just O
fine O
. O

  O
I O
've O
actually O
noticed O
I O
've O
been O
sick B-ADR
less O
since O
being O
on O
it O
. O

  O
Only O
issues O
I O
've O
had O
health O
wise O
is O
having O
a O
root O
canal O
and O
a O
crown O
twice O
; O
i O
got O
infections B-ADR
both O
times O
. O

  O
Turned O
out O
your O
supposed O
to O
take O
an O
antibiotic O
before O
any O
dental O
procedure O
on O
immunosuppressants O
. O

I O
forgot O
. O


I O
have O
found O
humira B-DRUG
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
my O
doctors O
have O
said O
that O
I O
have O
had O
some O
of O
the O
best O
results O
from O
it O
that O
they O
have O
seen O
. O

I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
6 O
months O
before O
switching O
to O
amgevita O
which O
I O
have O
been O
on O
for O
a O
year O
( O
which O
is O
especially O
exactly O
the O
same O
thing O
just O
not O
brand O
name O
so O
it O
cost O
the O
government O
less O
) O
. O

I O
saw O
my O
flares O
go O
from O
3 O
- O
4 O
daily O
to O
1 O
- O
2 O
monthly O
. O

Before O
I O
would O
have O
quite O
major O
flares B-ADR
as O
well O
that O
would O
swell B-ADR
up O
my O
tracts O
in O
the O
entire O
length O
of O
my O
groin O
, O
where O
as O
now O
they O
are O
quite O
small O
and O
definitely O
tolerable O
. O

If O
u O
have O
no O
problem O
with O
injecting O
yourself O
on O
a O
weekly O
basis O
than O
I O
ca O
n't O
recommend O
it O
enough O
. O

I O
actually O
had O
covid O
just O
last O
week O
and O
it O
did O
n't O
really O
agrivate O
my O
hs O
much O
at O
all O
, O
only O
some O
minor O
inflammation B-ADR
in O
the O
lymph O
node O
sorta O
area O
of O
my O
groin O
. O

And O
my O
covid O
symptoms O
in O
general O
really O
were O
n't O
that O
bad O
, O
same O
level O
as O
i O
would O
get O
with O
a O
normal O
cold O
. O

In O
regards O
to O
have O
I O
found O
myself O
getting O
more O
colds O
than O
usual O
, O
no O
not O
really O
, O
the O
same O
amount O
as O
usual O
. O

Unless O
your O
body O
is O
overly O
sensitive O
to O
illnesses B-ADR
usually O
I O
would O
n't O
worry O
too O
much O
about O
it O
lowering O
ur O
immune O
system O
too O
much O
in O
that O
respect O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
took O
around O
6 O
weeks O
I O
think O
. O

You O
will O
start O
seeing O
improvements O
before O
that O
though O
. O

You O
'll O
get O
a O
loading O
dose O
to O
start O
, O
it O
's O
kinda O
like O
a O
double O
dose O
. O

Then O
go O
on O
regular O
doses O
. O


I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
prior O
which O
is O
also O
a O
tnf O
inhibitor O
so O
I O
think O
my O
response O
was O
especially O
quick O
. O

It O
says O
14 O
- O
28 O
days O
for O
full O
effects O
but O
I O
had O
my O
infusion O
on O
Tuesday O
and O
I O
was O
out O
of O
pain B-ADR
Wednesday O
! O

We O
are O
on O
the O
same O
cycle O
it O
sounds O
like O
! O

Going O
again O
in O
a O
month O
? O


Exactly O
. O



 O
I O
am O
great O
now O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
have O
been O
clear O
for O
over O
3 O
years O
. O

The O
Humira B-DRUG
helped O
with O
my O
Psoriatic B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
as O
well O
. O

That O
helped O
me O
to O
lose O
50 O
lbs O
. O



 O
Being O
on O
the O
Otezla B-DRUG
helped O
me O
to O
see O
that O
something O
could O
help O
me O
, O
so O
I O
was O
grateful O
for O
the O
months O
I O
had O
clear O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
13 O
years O
. O


Adalimuab B-DRUG
is O
HUMIRA B-DRUG
so O
I O
wonder O
what O
the O
details O
of O
this O
study O
are O
! O


I O
’ve O
had O
similar O
issues O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

You O
may O
be O
starting O
an O
allergic B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
. O



 O
Taking O
Benadryl B-DRUG
helps O
. O

I O
have O
n’t O
solved O
the O
problem O
yet O
, O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
taking O
it O
in O
order O
to O
fight O
infection B-ADR
from O
a O
tick O
bite O
. O


Super O
late O
but O
I O
was O
looking O
to O
see O
if O
anyone O
was O
on O
2 O
and O
came O
across O
this O
lol O
. O

I O
’m O
on O
humira B-DRUG
( O
UC O
) O
and O
just O
took O
my O
first O
dose O
dupixent B-DRUG
( O
for O
my O
autoimmune O
allergy B-ADR
disease O
) O
as O
well O
and O
i O
kinda O
feel O
like O
shit O
today O
. O

How O
has O
it O
been O
being O
on O
two O
? O


Up O
to O
4 O
and O
still O
looking O
, O
cimzia B-DRUG
, O
humira B-DRUG
, O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
and O
remicade B-DRUG

i O
cycled O
through O
3 O
biologics O
( O
enbrel B-DRUG
, O
humira B-DRUG
, O
cosentyx B-DRUG
) O
that O
all O
stopped O
working O
for O
me O
and O
then O
went O
cold O
turkey O
for O
a O
few O
years O
( O
bad O
idea O
for O
that O
long O
, O
honestly O
probably O
bad O
in O
general O
) O
but O
now O
i O
’m O
back O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
works O
for O
me O
. O


( O
cold O
turkey O
was O
not O
on O
doctors O
orders O
but O
i O
was O
having O
diagnosis O
issues O
, O
insurance O
changes O
, O
many O
factors O
including O
the O
meds O
just O
not O
working O
anymore O
) O

i O
know O
everyone O
is O
different O
but O
that O
was O
the O
case O
for O
me O
. O

i O
had O
a O
short O
round O
of O
prednisone B-DRUG
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
flare O
i O
was O
in O
for O
those O
years O
off O
meds O
until O
the O
humira B-DRUG
arrived O
. O

it O
was O
like O
night O
and O
day O
, O
and O
now O
it O
’s O
mainly O
my O
diet O
/ O
weather O
/ O
hormones O
that O
effects O
my O
symptoms O
. O


have O
you O
tried O
combos O
of O
meds O
? O

or O
anything O
to O
help O
through O
a O
flare B-ADR
? O

or O
do O
the O
meds O
just O
seem O
stop B-ADR
working I-ADR
well O
over O
time O
? O


Sounds O
like O
I O
’m O
an O
outlier O
here O
but O
my O
HS O
was O
the O
same O
at O
both O
my O
HW O
and O
LW O
( O
and O
again O
my O
HW O
when O
I O
regained B-ADR
the I-ADR
weight I-ADR
) O
- O
which O
had O
about O
a O
75 O
lb O
difference O
between O
them O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
is O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
’s O
ever O
helped O
me O
. O


I O
'm O
so O
happy O
for O
you O
. O

Been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
11 O
years O
myself O
and O
it O
's O
been O
an O
absolute O
life O
changer O
. O


I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
almost O
1 O
year O
before O
it O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
for O
me O
. O

Currently O
taking O
Enbrel B-DRUG
weekly O
for O
the O
past O
6 O
months O
and O
it O
’s O
made O
my O
life O
so O
much O
better O
. O

The O
pain B-ADR
is O
still O
there O
, O
but O
a O
fraction O
of O
what O
it O
used O
to O
be O
! O

DONT O
GIVE O
UP O
HOPE O
. O

There O
is O
always O
new O
information O
, O
new O
research O
and O
it O
always O
gets O
worse O
before O
it O
gets O
better O
. O

You O
got O
this O
! O

😊 O
😊 O

Adalimumab B-DRUG
or O
Ada B-DRUG
. O

She‘s O
so O
sweet O
she O
’ll O
take O
your O
inflammation B-ADR
away O
. O


My O
doctor O
wanted O
to O
start O
me O
on O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
before O
we O
tried O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
but O
I O
found O
a O
new O
black O
box O
warning O
released O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
which O
scared O
me O
. O

  O
I O
said O
no O
to O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
. O

  O
I O
had O
bad O
luck O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
almost O
immediately O
started O
to O
feel O
worse O
. O

  O
The O
pain B-ADR
was O
unrelenting O
and O
kept O
me O
awake O
at O
night O
. O

  O
My O
inflammation B-ADR
markers O
went O
“ O
sky O
high O
“ O
according O
to O
my O
rheumatologist O
. O

So O
we O
switched O
to O
Orencia B-DRUG
. O

After O
nine O
doses O
of O
weekly O
I O
am O
starting O
to O
feel O
much O
better O
. O

  O
I O
told O
my O
rheumatologist O
Humira B-DRUG
made O
my O
pain B-ADR
and O
fatigue B-ADR
so O
much O
worse O
, O
but O
he O
said O
it O
could O
n’t O
do O
that O
. O

Good O
luck O
! O

  O
It O
takes O
time O
. O

Hang O
in O
there O
. O

♥ O
️ O

I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
almost O
2 O
years O
, O
all O
throughout O
covid O
. O

I O
've O
worked O
in O
Doctors O
offices O
that O
entire O
time O
and O
I O
never O
got O
covid O
. O

Because O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
I O
've O
gotten O
both O
shots O
and O
2 O
boosters O
, O
so O
I O
'm O
more O
protected O
than O
most O
people O
. O

Just O
be O
cautious O
. O

It O
's O
definitely O
helped O
my O
HS O
significantly O
. O


The O
worst O
part O
about O
humira B-DRUG
for O
me O
was O
waiting O
weeks O
and O
weeks O
to O
see O
if O
it O
will O
work O
. O

That O
patience O
was O
the O
hardest O
for O
me O
. O

PsA O
treatments O
take O
up O
to O
3 O
months O
to O
work O
. O



 O
Also O
, O
if O
it O
works O
but O
loses B-ADR
effectiveness I-ADR
before O
the O
two O
weeks O
are O
up O
during O
the O
first O
3 O
months O
, O
do O
n't O
worry O
, O
it O
is O
working O
. O

Give O
it O
time O
. O

Past O
the O
3 O
month O
mark O
and O
it O
is O
losing B-ADR
effectiveness I-ADR
, O
explore O
adding O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
first O
. O

Be O
wary O
of O
jumping O
med O
to O
med O
. O

The O
immune O
system O
will O
become O
immune O
to O
each O
biologic O
.... O
we O
just O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
long O
it O
will O
take O
per O
person O
. O

So O
if O
you O
jump O
around O
on O
meds O
and O
then O
realize O
that O
humira B-DRUG
was O
as O
good O
as O
it O
was O
gon O
na O
get O
, O
then O
go O
back O
to O
humira B-DRUG
, O
it O
might O
not O
work O
. O



 O
Your O
goal O
with O
meds O
is O
to O
stop O
disease B-ADR
progression I-ADR
, O
but O
it O
wo O
n't O
undo O
damage B-ADR
. O

So O
aim O
to O
get O
to O
feeling O
" O
good O
enough O
" O
with O
a O
med O
. O

Other O
therapies O
can O
help O
boost O
it O
like O
physiotherapy O
to O
strengthen O
muscles O
to O
best O
support O
joints O
or O
undo O
muscle B-ADR
weakness I-ADR
that O
developed O
from O
trying O
to O
prevent O
hurt B-ADR
from O
happening O
over O
the O
years O
. O



 O
Good O
luck O
and O
welcome O
to O
the O
club O

I O
am O
fairly O
perplexed O
would O
you O
mind O
sharing O
what O
the O
name O
of O
your O
health O
plan O
is O
? O

You O
may O
have O
donut O
hole O
coverage O
or O
something O
but O
generally O
speaking O
its O
the O
other O
way O
around O

Hi O
, O
I O
'm O
diagnosed O
too O
with O
decalvans O
( O
with O
biopsy O
) O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
24 O
med O
student O
and O
I O
read O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
condition O
. O

This O
is O
a O
problem O
in O
the O
imune O
system O
, O
basically O
its O
  O
hypersensitivity O
to O
bacteria O
that O
lives O
naturally O
on O
your O
scalp O
and O
in O
your O
hair O
follicles O
. O

( O
Mostly O
staphylococcus O
aureus O
, O
but O
not O
necessarily O
) O
. O

In O
my O
case O
the O
biopsy O
came O
back O
sterile O
with O
no O
staphylococcus O
aureus O
. O

Doctors O
usually O
prescribe O
antibiotics O
with O
strong O
anti O
inflammatory O
effect O
( O
usually O
rifampicin B-DRUG
and O
clindamycin B-DRUG
) O
, O
in O
harsh O
cases O
they O
even O
prescribe O
immune O
suppressor O
( O
like O
humira B-DRUG
) O
. O

I O
personally O
did O
nt O
want O
to O
take O
these O
medications O
. O

I O
started O
using O
benzoyl B-DRUG
peroxide I-DRUG
4 I-DRUG
% I-DRUG
( O
panoxyl B-DRUG
) O
. O

And O
within O
a O
month O
it O
cleared O
all O
my O
bumps O
( O
And O
my O
case O
was O
n't O
easy O
) O
. O

I O
had O
pretty O
bad O
hair B-ADR
loss I-ADR
but O
I O
can O
see O
that O
the O
hair O
start O
growing O
back O
in O
most O
of O
the O
bald O
spots O
( O
but O
taking O
forever O
) O
. O

Benzoyl B-DRUG
peroxide I-DRUG
is O
helping O
because O
it O
clears O
bacteria O
from O
your O
scalp O
very O
effectively O
, O
so O
your O
immune O
system O
have O
less O
bacteria O
to O
attack O
. O

I O
strongly O
advise O
you O
to O
order O
it O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
( O
try O
amazon O
) O
. O

And O
in O
case O
you O
suffer O
from O
pain B-ADR
that O
interfere O
with O
your O
sleep O
or O
daily O
functioning O
- O
take O
NSAID O
. O

The O
worst O
part O
is O
the O
pain B-ADR
. O

So O
if O
you O
can O
manage O
it O
first O
it O
will O
help O
you O
think O
more O
clearly O
about O
how O
you O
want O
to O
manage O
this O
condition O
. O

Its O
undoubtedly O
a O
shitty O
condition O
, O
but O
it O
could O
have O
been O
much O
worse O
, O
everybody O
carry O
their O
own O
bag O
of O
problem O
, O
even O
if O
you O
ca O
nt O
always O
see O
it O
. O

Beside O
that O
- O
I O
advise O
you O
to O
do O
a O
biopsy O
to O
make O
sure O
this O
is O
really O
decalvans O
because O
there O
are O
many O
conditions O
that O
look O
similar O
, O
and O
doctors O
can O
mistakenly O
diagnose O
. O

Wishing O
you O
great O
health O
and O
good O
luck O
. O

You O
can O
send O
me O
questions O
if O
you O
have O
any O
! O


You O
do O
n't O
use O
budesonid B-DRUG
or O
prednisone B-DRUG
long O
term O
, O
they O
have O
significant O
side O
effects O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
understand O
if O
messlamine B-DRUG
and O
co O
fail O
you O
may O
use O
prednisone B-DRUG
short O
term O
to O
control O
acute O
inflammation B-ADR
and O
than O
you O
transition O
to O
biologics O
/ O
immunosuppression O
. O

Usually O
people O
start O
with O
remicade B-DRUG
than O
entyvio B-DRUG
/ O
humira B-DRUG
/ O
stelara B-DRUG
and O
so O
on O
. O

You O
can O
ask O
her O
why O
she O
chose O
zeposia B-DRUG
first O
, O
but O
definitely O
do O
n't O
stay O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
or O
budesonid B-DRUG

MiraLAX B-DRUG
helps O
with O
the O
day O
to O
day O
constipation B-ADR
. O

But O
you O
really O
should O
be O
on O
some O
sort O
of O
IBD B-ADR
meds O
. O



 O
Inflammation B-ADR
is O
likely O
causing O
your O
symptoms B-ADR
and O
you O
need O
medication O
to O
help O
. O

Some O
GIs O
are O
unfamiliar O
( O
or O
straight O
up O
in O
denial O
) O
with O
constipation B-ADR
in O
IBD B-ADR
. O

It O
's O
important O
you O
see O
a O
GI O
who O
specializes O
in O
IBD B-ADR
since O
you O
are O
not O
a O
" O
textbook O
" O
case O
. O



 O
I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
4 O
months O
and O
I O
was O
having O
1 O
BM O
a O
day O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
my O
life O
. O

I O
was O
always O
a O
once O
every O
3 O
- O
4 O
days O
. O

No O
more O
cramps B-ADR
. O

No O
more O
bloat B-ADR
. O

No O
more O
GERD B-ADR
. O

It O
was O
amazing O
. O

Unfortunately O
I O
failed O
it O
quickly O
and O
am O
waiting O
for O
approval O
for O
Entyvio B-DRUG
. O


i O
was O
hospitalized O
because O
i O
was O
proven O
to O
be O
failing O
humira B-DRUG
but O
my O
insurance O
did O
n’t O
cover O
the O
initial O
dose O
of O
stelara B-DRUG
so O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
using O
medicine O
that O
did O
n’t O
work O
because O
my O
insurance O
knows O
my O
body O
better O
than O
my O
doctor O
and O
i O
had O
to O
fight O
( O
still O
am O
actually O
) O
trying O
to O
get O
the O
initial O
infusion O
, O
it O
’s O
awful O
. O

it O
’s O
literally O
just O
the O
infusion O
too O
my O
insurance O
covers O
the O
maintenance O
doses O
. O


Fast O
. O

I O
do O
my O
humira B-DRUG
shots O
every O
2 O
weeks O
and O
fast O
is O
good O

Going O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
was O
a O
bit O
stressful O
, O
partly O
because O
it O
needs O
to O
be O
injected O
, O
and O
partly O
because O
of O
the O
unknown O
. O

  O
However O
, O
my O
experience O
( O
and O
that O
of O
most O
others O
I O
've O
seen O
) O
is O
that O
noticeable O
side O
effects O
are O
very O
rare O
. O

  O
I O
've O
personally O
not O
noticed O
anything O
I O
could O
directly O
correlate O
to O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
though O
I O
might O
bruise B-ADR
slightly O
easier O
. O

  O
The O
only O
major O
side O
effect O
that O
I O
've O
heard O
about O
and O
still O
somewhat O
worry O
about O
is O
simply O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
're O
suppressing O
part O
of O
your O
immune O
system O
, O
so O
some O
illnesses O
can O
get O
worse O
. O

  O
While O
that O
sounds O
scary O
, O
it O
depends O
a O
lot O
on O
how O
often O
you O
get O
sick B-ADR
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

  O
Even O
then O
, O
it O
is O
often O
hard O
to O
tell O
whether O
or O
if O
the O
illness B-ADR
gets O
worse O
because O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
or O
just O
because O
it O
was O
a O
worse O
than O
usual O
variant O
going O
around O
. O

  O
Personally O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
point O
to O
a O
single O
side O
effect O
and O
say O
" O
that O
's O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
" O
. O

  O
The O
only O
way O
it O
has O
effected O
me O
is O
that O
I O
wear O
a O
mask O
more O
often O
, O
but O
still O
not O
continuously O
. O



 O
Side O
note O
: O
One O
thing O
I O
've O
read O
is O
that O
some O
people O
get O
a O
strong O
stinging B-ADR
sensation I-ADR
when O
injecting O
the O
medication O
. O

  O
This O
is O
apparently O
fixed O
by O
getting O
the O
" O
citrate O
free O
" O
version O
. O

  O
Personally O
, O
pinching O
the O
skin O
before O
injecting O
the O
medication O
is O
about O
as O
bad O
as O
the O
actual O
injection O
itself O
, O
there O
is O
pretty O
much O
no O
pain B-ADR
unless O
I O
forgot O
to O
leave O
it O
out O
of O
the O
refrigerator O
for O
30 O
minutes O
before O
injecting O
to O
warm O
up O
a O
bit O
. O


I O
got O
“ O
lucky O
” O
I O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
surgery O
the O
day O
my O
husband O
tested O
positive O
so O
they O
had O
me O
holding O
off O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
then O
knowing O
I O
had O
been O
exposed O
and O
was O
also O
trying O
to O
postpone O
surgery O
I O
was O
still O
holding O
off O
. O

I O
tested O
positive O
2 O
days O
later O
and O
now O
I O
’m O
thinking O
it O
’s O
probably O
good O
that O
I O
skipped O
the O
dose O

On O
it O
’s O
own O
it O
’s O
not O
necessarily O
better O
or O
worse O
( O
at O
least O
not O
to O
my O
knowledge O
) O
. O

For O
me O
it O
’s O
a O
worse O
option O
because O
I O
built O
up O
antibodies O
to O
the O
same O
biologic O
group O
that O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
in O
, O
so O
instead O
of O
taking O
a O
regular O
Humira B-DRUG
injection O
I O
have O
to O
do O
that O
plus O
a O
second O
immunosuppressant O
in O
order O
for O
it O
to O
work O
. O

I O
get O
incredibly O
and O
frequently O
sick B-ADR
as O
is O
and O
it O
just O
opens O
me O
up O
to O
having O
a O
higher O
risk O
of O
infections B-ADR
/ O
side O
effects O

That O
sounds O
so O
awful O
I O
’m O
sorry O
you O
’re O
dealing O
with O
that O
. O

Does O
orlissa B-DRUG
come O
as O
an O
injectable O
? O

I O
wonder O
if O
a O
different O
delivery O
method O
might O
be O
easier O
to O
handle O
. O


I O
have O
n’t O
noticed O
a O
difference O
in O
my O
symptoms B-ADR
in O
the O
spring O
or O
any O
other O
patterns O
except O
that O
my O
flares B-ADR
are O
100 O
% O
linked O
to O
hormonal O
fluctuations O
and O
sun O
exposure O
so O
far O
. O

I O
did O
have O
bladder O
symptoms O
after O
tons O
of O
foods O
but O
that O
’s O
gone O
since O
being O
on O
all O
my O
meds O
. O

The O
worst O
of O
it O
was O
fall O
/ O
winter O
last O
year O
( O
when O
I O
was O
going O
through O
wild O
hormonal B-ADR
changes I-ADR
post O
hysterectomy O
) O
before O
I O
started O
the O
biologics O
, O
but O
I O
’ve O
felt O
really O
shitty O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

My O
current O
meds O
started O
failing O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
but O
I O
think O
that O
’s O
just O
bad O
luck O
. O


I O
do O
n’t O
think O
that O
plaquenil B-DRUG
working O
or O
not O
working O
affects O
diagnosis O
at O
all O
, O
whether O
it O
’s O
lupus B-ADR
or O
something O
else O
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
on O
it O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
and O
I O
think O
the O
only O
thing O
it O
’s O
helped O
is O
I O
have O
less O
mouth O
sores O
but O
they O
still O
think O
I O
have O
lupus B-ADR
even O
though O
it O
did O
n’t O
help O
with O
much O
else O
. O

I O
think O
some O
meds O
just O
do O
n’t O
work O
for O
everyone O
and O
plaquenil B-DRUG
is O
  O
the O
safest O
and O
cheapest O
thing O
to O
try O
first O
. O

Also O
unfortunately O
insurance O
companies O
want O
to O
see O
that O
you O
tried O
the O
cheap O
drugs O
first O
because O
they O
do O
n’t O
always O
like O
paying O
for O
the O
big O
guns O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
is O
usually O
the O
easiest O
biologic O
to O
get O
approved O
, O
depending O
on O
diagnosis O
of O
course O
, O
but O
studies O
have O
shown O
it O
can O
improve O
IC O
so O
it O
might O
be O
worth O
asking O
your O
urologist O
and O
rheum O
about O
it O
if O
they O
think O
it O
might O
help O
. O

Biologics O
are O
serious O
meds O
but O
it O
sounds O
like O
your O
quality O
of O
life O
is O
suffering O
and O
you O
need O
help O
. O


I O
have O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
I O
guess O
about O
3 O
years O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
do O
anything O
different O
at O
all O
. O

I O
never O
wear O
a O
mask O
, O
have O
had O
no O
Covid O
jabs O
and O
did O
have O
Covid O
twice O
. O

I O
work O
outside O
and O
frequently O
get O
cuts O
and O
scrapes O
, O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
with O
anything O
getting O
infected B-ADR
. O

I O
suppose O
everyone O
’s O
immune O
system O
is O
different O
but O
I O
challenge O
my O
daily O
. O

My O
health O
seems O
better O
than O
it O
ever O
has O
been O
. O

I O
try O
to O
live O
life O
as O
normal O
as O
possible O
. O

Fresh O
air O
and O
sunlight O
and O
some O
good O
ole O
garden O
dirt O
will O
do O
wonders O
for O
your O
mind O
and O
spirit O
. O


Dude O
needs O
some O
Humira B-DRUG
or O
something O
. O

That O
psoriasis B-ADR
is O
out O
of O
control O
. O


The O
person O
's O
healthcare O
provider O
is O
useless O
in O
this O
regard O
. O

They O
seem O
to O
have O
done O
a O
good O
job O
managing O
the O
guy O
's O
Crohn O
's O
, O
but O
have O
had O
no O
guidance O
at O
all O
to O
give O
over O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
regarding O
* O
how O
* O
immunocompromised O
he O
should O
think O
of O
himself O
as O
being O
. O

  O
Also O
no O
help O
whatever O
in O
providing O
access O
to O
Evusheld B-DRUG
( O
a O
drug O
that O
boosts O
the O
immune O
system O
of O
the O
immunocompromised O
) O
or O
even O
giving O
basic O
information O
about O
whether O
the O
man O
needs O
Evusheld O
, O
how O
he O
would O
get O
it O
if O
he O
needed O
it O
, O
etc O
. O



 O
Obviously O
if O
Paxlovid B-DRUG
is O
likely O
to O
be O
helpful O
to O
him O
it O
will O
also O
be O
necessary O
to O
double O
- O
check O
that O
Paxlovid B-DRUG
does O
not O
interact O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

  O
But O
that O
is O
pretty O
simple O
to O
do O
. O



 O
Excuse O
me O
for O
sounding O
kind O
of O
cranky O
, O
but O
at O
this O
point O
I O
have O
heard O
so O
many O
stories O
about O
unhelpful O
doctors O
that O
the O
phrase O
" O
ask O
your O
doctor O
" O
really O
irritates O
the O
shit O
out O
of O
me O
. O


Yep O
, O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
Azathioprine B-DRUG
for O
years O
now O
. O

I O
take O
ferrous O
fumigate O
, O
one O
tablet O
a O
day O
as O
my O
doctor O
suggested O
... O
Like O
5 O
years O
ago O
. O

And O
just O
any O
multivitamins O
I O
find O
, O
ATM O
I O
have O
the O
centrum O
ones O
, O
but O
before O
I O
had O
like O
boots O
own O
brand O
etc O
. O



 O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
was O
humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
getting O
my O
anemia B-ADR
under O
control O
, O
being O
able O
to O
eat O
and O
move O
. O

It O
took O
a O
while O
of O
just O
walking O
, O
swimming O
etc O
as O
well O
as O
taking O
iron O
supplements O
and O
eating O
to O
stop O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
feet B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
god O
me O
feet O
used O
to O
hurt B-ADR
so O
much O
. O

I O
did O
basically O
loose O
all O
muscle O
and O
strength O
during O
a O
flare B-ADR
up O
that O
led O
to O
diagnosis O
and O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O


Yes O
I O
’m O
about O
2 O
months O
into O
humira B-DRUG
so O
far O
3 O
- O
4 O
days O
later O
it O
always O
shows O
up O
like O
a O
mosquito O
bite O
. O


I O
am O
only O
on O
accutane B-DRUG
right O
now O
, O
will O
be O
starting O
humira B-DRUG
in O
a O
month O
or O
so O

Humira B-DRUG
caused O
me O
the O
most O
insane O
anxiety B-ADR
issues O
and O
borderline O
psychosis B-ADR
so O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
it O
. O

Mine O
was O
also O
a O
couple O
days O
after O
injection O
. O

I O
’d O
monitor O
those O
symptoms O
closely O
cause O
mine O
got O
bad O
enough O
to O
the O
point O
that O
I O
went O
to O
a O
psychiatric O
hospital O
for O
a O
night O
. O


I O
will O
never O
ever O
forget O
every O
family O
member O
on O
my O
dad O
's O
side O
telling O
me O
to O
cut O
out O
gluten O
and O
dairy O
, O
totally O
oblivious O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
first O
solid O
food O
I O
ate O
in O
almost O
a O
week O
was O
a O
bagel O
with O
cream O
cheese O
and O
it O
felt O
like O
heaven O
. O

My O
uncle O
told O
me O
I O
should O
" O
walk O
" O
to O
help O
my O
arthralgia B-ADR
symptoms O
which O
mimics O
rheumatoid B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
. O



 O
People O
have O
suggested O
kimchi O
, O
kombucha O
, O
all O
these O
bubbly O
, O
spicy O
, O
fermented O
things O
that O
make O
me O
feel O
like O
death B-ADR
. O

Some O
guy O
I O
met O
in O
class O
suggested O
I O
take O
some O
lion O
's O
mane O
mushroom O
supplement O
? O

I O
did O
n't O
even O
bother O
looking O
at O
it O
, O
I O
'm O
so O
tired O
of O
this O
" O
natural O
cures O
" O
bullshit O
. O



 O
It O
was O
n't O
advice O
, O
but O
my O
favourite O
thing O
in O
the O
whole O
wide O
world O
was O
me O
telling O
my O
aunt O
I O
was O
starting O
humira B-DRUG
and O
she O
went O
" O
oh O
, O
is O
that O
like O
turmeric O
? O

" O

I O
took O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
a O
few O
years O
with O
decent O
results O
then O
suddenly O
started O
having O
more O
pain B-ADR
and O
stiffness B-ADR
. O

Rheumy O
switched O
me O
to O
Remicade B-DRUG
every O
8 O
weeks O
, O
later O
to O
every O
6 O
weeks O
( O
pain B-ADR
and O
stiffness B-ADR
returned O
around O
week O
7 O
and O
was O
miserable O
) O
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
on O
it O
for O
over O
5 O
years O
with O
only O
1 O
major O
flare B-ADR
( O
husband O
died O
, O
stress O
was O
out O
- O
of O
- O
this O
- O
world O
) O
, O
only O
side O
effect O
was O
extreme O
fatigue B-ADR
on O
day O
of O
infusion O
and O
I O
’m O
doing O
well O
. O


My O
crohns O
tore O
through O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
remicade B-DRUG
, O
Stelara B-DRUG
, O
cimzia B-DRUG
like O
it O
was O
all O
nothing O
. O

I O
think O
the O
longest O
I O
got O
was O
maybe O
2 O
years O
on O
Stelara B-DRUG
and O
it O
was O
a O
slow O
decline O
more O
than O
anything O
( O
almost O
had O
a O
full O
narrowing O
and O
had O
to O
get O
it O
ballooned O
open O
) O
. O

Entyvio B-DRUG
is O
what O
is O
totally O
working O
for O
me O
! O

! O

! O

I O
've O
gained O
15lbs O
, O
and O
am O
probably O
the O
healthiest O
I O
've O
ever O
been O
in O
my O
life O
. O

The O
doc O
says O
it O
's O
a O
different O
kind O
of O
biological O
than O
the O
others O
and O
so O
folks O
who O
do O
n't O
react O
to O
those O
tend O
to O
do O
better O
on O
it O
. O

If O
remicade B-DRUG
is O
n't O
working O
for O
you O
, O
I O
'd O
ask O
about O
entyvio B-DRUG
! O


You O
wanna O
step O
to O
my O
grandson O
? O

Here O
hold O
my O
Ensure O
, O
I O
’m O
gon O
na O
kick O
your O
ass O
until O
my O
arthritis B-ADR
kicks O
in O
… O
and O
I O
just O
just O
took O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


Same O
thing O
for O
me O
. O

I O
had O
two O
older O
GI O
docs O
, O
spent O
8 O
months O
on O
no O
meds O
until O
I O
landed O
in O
the O
hospital O
with O
a O
10/10 O
pain B-ADR
and O
flare B-ADR
. O

Then O
did O
the O
“ O
bottom O
up O
” O
approach O
to O
meds O
, O
going O
from O
mesalamine B-DRUG
to O
azathioprine B-DRUG
to O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
all O
the O
while O
flaring B-ADR
for O
3 O
years O
straight O
, O
until O
we O
finally O
landed O
on O
Stelara B-DRUG
and O
it O
worked O
for O
me O
. O


The O
European O
Crohns O
and O
Colitis B-ADR
Organization O
( O
ECCO O
) O
now O
recommends O
a O
“ O
top O
down O
” O
approach O
, O
starting O
with O
biologics O
( O
Remicade B-DRUG
or O
Humira B-DRUG
are O
both O
great O
choices O
) O
. O

It O
leads O
to O
milder O
course O
of O
disease O
overall O
if O
started O
early O
. O


Definitely O
get O
a O
second O
opinion O
, O
and O
I O
can O
link O
you O
the O
ECCO O
recommendation O
because O
it O
might O
help O
to O
bring O
to O
your O
doctor O
. O


For O
me O
it O
’s O
not O
the O
smell O
that O
makes O
me O
gag O
( O
although O
that O
does O
n’t O
help O
) O
but O
actually O
the O
size O
of O
it O
. O

It O
’s O
not O
even O
big O
but O
anything O
bigger O
than O
an O
apple O
seed O
makes O
me O
gag O
. O

And O
yeah O
it O
’s O
hard O
to O
take O
it O
when O
I O
’m O
prescribed O
2 O
- O
3 O
a O
day O
. O

I O
’m O
already O
on O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
so O
that O
’s O
not O
an O
issue O
but O
my O
rheum O
said O
he O
did O
n’t O
want O
to O
put O
me O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
he O
did O
n’t O
give O
a O
reason O
but O
I O
’m O
assuming O
it O
may O
be O
because O
I O
’m O
a O
young O
woman O
who O
has O
n’t O
started O
a O
family O
yet O
? O



 O
I O
ended O
up O
doing O
my O
first O
dose O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
last O
Friday O
. O

My O
dr O
said O
I O
should O
be O
taking O
the O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
along O
with O
it O
, O
so O
does O
that O
mean O
Humira B-DRUG
wo O
n’t O
work O
for O
me O
unless O
I O
start O
getting O
better O
at O
taking O
the O
pills O
? O


An O
official O
diagnosis O
after O
a O
colonoscopy O
? O

Or O
was O
the O
doctor O
just O
speculating O
? O



 O
If O
you O
've O
been O
diagnosed O
you O
should O
get O
on O
medication O
ASAP O
. O

You O
want O
to O
stop O
the O
disease O
from O
getting O
worse O
, O
not O
wait O
until O
the O
damage O
is O
done O
. O

But O
they O
may O
try O
less O
powerful O
medications O
before O
going O
to O
one O
's O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
/ O
Remicade B-DRUG
. O


I O
hope O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
that O
I O
laughed O
a O
little O
bit O
at O
the O
comment O
you O
made O
, O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O
you O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
that O
... O
I O
am O
not O
even O
sure O
if O
a O
wound O
care O
specialist O
can O
even O
do O
anything O
for O
hidradenitis B-ADR
suppurativa I-ADR
... O
😭 O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
why O
they O
just O
let O
it O
get O
so O
out O
of O
control O
to O
where O
it O
spread O
like O
it O
did O
. O

It O
was O
just O
one O
spot O
in O
2013 O
, O
they O
could O
have O
taken O
care O
of O
it O
then O
like O
they O
put O
in O
their O
chart O
that O
they O
were O
considering O
excision O
surgery O
of O
it O
. O

Instead O
they O
just O
put O
a O
post O
- O
it O
note O
" O
humira B-DRUG
" O
like O
it O
was O
God O
's O
greatest O
discovery O
and O
sent O
me O
on O
my O
way O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
that O
I O
would O
have O
been O
in O
remission O
this O
whole O
time O
if O
they O
would O
've O
removed O
that O
one O
spot O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
am O
stuck O
with O
two O
people O
saying O
" O
no O
surgery O
" O
even O
though O
it O
's O
supposedly O
the O
worst O
they O
ever O
seen O
.. O
? O

I O
'm O
tired O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
has O
only O
helped O
me O
for O
so O
long O
but O
I O
’m O
going O
to O
try O
remicade B-DRUG
. O

Clindamycin B-DRUG
and O
rifampin B-DRUG
combo O
helps O
actually O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O

Antibacterial O
soap O
, O
like O
dove O
gold O
. O

There O
’s O
always O
corticosteroids O
either O
local O
or O
systemic O

I O
’m O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
it O
cleared O
the O
uveitis B-ADR
up O
quickly O
and O
improved O
other O
autoimmune O
symptoms B-ADR
quickly O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
think O
I O
’d O
go O
for O
surgery O
to O
avoid O
it O
. O

The O
steroid O
drops O
cause O
or O
accelerate O
cataracts B-ADR
so O
you O
’re O
probably O
looking O
ay O
more O
surgery O
to O
keep O
using O
them O
. O



 O
This O
is O
pretty O
serious O
business O
, O
have O
you O
looked O
into O
a O
second O
opinion O
? O

And O
, O
have O
you O
seen O
a O
rheumatologist O
? O

They O
’re O
an O
appropriate O
specialist O
to O
evaluate O
reoccurring O
uveitis B-ADR
. O


I O
already O
had O
psoriasis B-ADR
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
think O
it O
’s O
any O
worse O
than O
prior O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
’s O
well O
controlled O
with O
topical O
steroids O
. O



 O
I O
had O
horrible O
nausea B-ADR
with O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
the O
first O
few O
months O
but O
that O
eventually O
settled O
out O
and O
now O
I O
do O
n’t O
seem O
to O
experience O
any O
side O
effects O
. O

  O
Even O
after O
the O
upped O
my O
dose O
from O
twice O
monthly O
to O
weekly O
. O


I O
’ve O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
three O
years O
now O
and O
have O
had O
covid O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
year O
, O
thankfully O
it O
was O
n’t O
as O
bad O
as O
I O
was O
expecting O
three O
extremely O
rough O
days O
and O
that O
was O
really O
it O
although O
my O
taste O
and O
smell O
have O
n’t O
completely O
came O
back O
and O
it O
’s O
been O
more O
than O
six O
months O

The O
humira B-DRUG
helps O
with O
the O
flares B-ADR
but O
will O
not O
help O
with O
any O
past O
damage B-ADR
with O
that O
said O
I O
still O
get O
flares B-ADR
and O
itch B-ADR
but O
nothing O
compared O
to O
before O
humira B-DRUG

I O
also O
have O
to O
take O
antibiotics O
from O
time O
to O
time O
due O
to O
flares O
I O
’m O
in O
the O
tunneling O
stages O
of O
hs O
And O
experience O
extreme O
itching B-ADR
from O
past O
flares B-ADR

I O
use O
lots O
of O
coconut O
oil O
for O
the O
itching B-ADR
and O
also O
when O
I O
flare B-ADR
it O
helps O
me O
a O
lot O

I O
think O
it O
’s O
worth O
a O
shot O
just O
for O
some O
relief O
feel O
free O
to O
reach O
out O
with O
any O
questions O
and O
good O
luck O

I O
will O
tell O
you O
, O
I O
feel O
so O
bad O
for O
him O
, O
I O
do O
injections O
before O
I O
hit O
any O
I&D. O

I O
do O
n’t O
hear O
of O
many O
men O
that O
suffer O
! O

Sphiro B-DRUG
might O
not O
work O
for O
him O
. O


It O
took O
me O
yeats O
to O
get O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
literally O
almost O
2 O
for O
my O
ins O
to O
ok O
it O
. O


You O
always O
have O
to O
remember O
that O
some O
people O
just O
go O
into O
remission O
on O
their O
own O
, O
I O
ca O
n’t O
remember O
the O
exact O
numbers O
but O
I O
think O
in O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
trials O
it O
was O
about O
14 O
% O
of O
people O
on O
a O
placebo O
were O
in O
remission O
after O
a O
year O
. O

So O
when O
you O
hear O
anecdotes O
about O
people O
getting O
into O
remission O
you O
need O
to O
remember O
there O
is O
a O
chance O
they O
would O
have O
just O
gone O
into O
remission O
without O
whatever O
treatment O
they O
are O
advocating O
for O
. O


Most O
likely O
is O
n’t O
a O
diagnosis O
. O

Colonoscopy O
will O
confirm O
. O

  O
Not O
common O
for O
her O
age O
to O
get O
crohns O
just O
normally O
occurs O
a O
lot O
earlier O
. O

I O
would O
wait O
for O
the O
diagnosis O
. O

I O
will O
say O
I O
never O
chose O
a O
med O
. O

I O
was O
rarely O
given O
an O
option O
. O

43 O
years O
with O
crohns O
. O

62 O
now O
and O
on O
humira B-DRUG

No O
hard O
data O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
consume O
some O
weed B-DRUG
nightly O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
it O
does O
a O
whole O
lot O
for O
my O
pain B-ADR
, O
but O
I O
also O
have O
n't O
noticed O
any O
obvious O
negatives O
either O
, O
and O
have O
never O
heard O
of O
any O
. O

I O
have O
a O
follow O
- O
up O
with O
my O
rheumatologist O
and O
it O
's O
a O
legal O
area O
, O
so O
assuming O
I O
remember O
I O
'll O
ask O
. O


The O
same O
thing O
happened O
to O
me O
. O

It O
means O
you O
've O
developed O
antibodies O
to O
Remicade B-DRUG
. O

If O
you O
have O
antibodies O
to O
it O
, O
it O
's O
no O
longer O
safe O
for O
you O
to O
take O
it O
. O

I O
would O
be O
shocked O
if O
your O
doctor O
allowed O
you O
to O
have O
another O
infusion O
- O
please O
insist O
on O
testing O
for O
antibodies O
. O



 O
I O
would O
definitely O
switch O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

You O
may O
end O
up O
failing O
that O
one O
too O
, O
since O
it O
's O
so O
similar O
to O
Remicade B-DRUG
, O
but O
I O
would O
try O
it O
now O
as O
opposed O
to O
Entyvio B-DRUG
or O
Stelara B-DRUG
. O

( O
Just O
because O
of O
the O
antibody O
response O
, O
Remicade B-DRUG
/ O
Humira B-DRUG
biosimilarity O
, O
the O
fact O
that O
our O
medicine O
options O
are O
limited O
- O
Humira B-DRUG
may O
not O
work O
for O
you O
in O
several O
years O
. O

Love O
Stelara B-DRUG
though O
, O
it O
has O
kept O
me O
in O
my O
longest O
remission O
yet O
! O

) O

Yup O
, O
ended O
up O
flaring O
and O
only O
had O
a O
partial O
response O
once O
humira B-DRUG
was O
restarted O
. O

I O
switched O
to O
Enbrel B-DRUG
in O
January O
. O

Enbrel B-DRUG
has O
been O
fantastic O
for O
my O
joints O
but O
not O
for O
my O
gut O
. O

I O
just O
really O
really O
wish O
my O
immune O
system O
would O
get O
it O
together O
. O


My O
husband O
hits O
a O
THC O
cart O
daily O
while O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
he O
has O
n't O
had O
any O
problems O
. O


Sponsored O
by O
Bengay B-DRUG
and O
Humira B-DRUG

I O
'll O
be O
sure O
to O
ask O
a O
doctor O
for O
more O
advice O
before O
getting O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O



 O
Thanks O
for O
the O
reply O
. O

Good O
to O
know O
that O
at O
least O
for O
some O
people O
they O
can O
be O
active O
in O
the O
outdoors O
without O
being O
affected O
much O
. O


Hey O
there O
! O

I O
literally O
just O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
too O
( O
I O
take O
my O
second O
dose O
tomorrow O
) O
, O
so O
I O
know O
the O
panic B-ADR
you O
're O
going O
through O
! O



 O
Do O
you O
have O
an O
auto O
injector O
( O
like O
an O
EpiPen B-DRUG
? O

) O
or O
a O
full O
- O
on O
syringe O
? O

If O
you O
have O
the O
syringe O
, O
see O
if O
you O
can O
switch O
over O
to O
the O
auto O
injector O
: O
you O
ca O
n't O
see O
the O
needle O
at O
all O
, O
and O
it O
's O
all O
self O
- O
contained O
- O
all O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
push O
a O
little O
button O
( O
it O
'll O
make O
a O
loud O
click O
noise O
) O
, O
and O
hold O
it O
on O
your O
body O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
while O
it O
releases O
the O
medication O
! O

Auto O
injectors O
simplify O
the O
whole O
process O
, O
and O
the O
needle O
itself O
is O
so O
small O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
hurt O
! O

Once O
it O
's O
done O
, O
you O
toss O
the O
whole O
thing O
into O
a O
sharps O
container O
and O
it O
's O
out O
of O
sight O
, O
out O
of O
mind O
! O



 O
When O
I O
do O
an O
auto O
injector O
dose O
( O
I O
've O
done O
it O
a O
lot O
for O
other O
medications O
in O
the O
past O
) O
, O
I O
take O
a O
deep O
breath O
in O
and O
then O
let O
it O
out O
as O
I O
push O
the O
button O
. O

It O
helps O
to O
release O
that O
tension O
that O
's O
built O
up O
in O
anticipation O
of O
the O
actual O
shot O
. O

I O
've O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
blood O
work O
and O
injections O
in O
my O
life O
, O
so O
I O
get O
poked O
a O
* O
lot O
. O

* O
Something O
that O
I O
've O
learned O
helps O
me O
distract O
from O
the O
shot O
is O
wiggling O
or O
clenching O
/ O
unclenching O
another O
part O
of O
my O
body O
and O
focusing O
on O
it O
. O

  O
It O
helps O
to O
keep O
your O
brain O
occupied O
on O
something O
else O
, O
which O
will O
help O
lessen O
your O
anxiety B-ADR
. O

Pinching O
works O
great O
too O
- O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
forget O
about O
a O
paper O
cut O
when O
you O
stub O
your O
toe O
! O



 O
Best O
of O
luck O
to O
you O
! O

You O
've O
got O
this O
❤ O
️ O

Good O
luck O
! O

! O

! O

! O

I O
’m O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
flare B-ADR
because O
Entyvio B-DRUG
either O
failed O
or O
burned O
out O
of O
my O
system O
too O
quick O
( O
waiting O
on O
blood O
work O
to O
determine O
which O
is O
which O
) O
Humira B-DRUG
failed O
and O
I O
could O
n’t O
take O
Meslamine B-DRUG
due O
to O
an O
allergic B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
. O

So O
stelara B-DRUG
is O
my O
next O
option O
then O
surgery O
conversations O
. O

Just O
know O
you O
are O
n’t O
alone O
! O


Only O
live O
vaccines O
are O
contraindicated O
for O
people O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Most O
vaccines O
are O
not O
live O
vaccines O
. O


All O
other O
vaccines O
are O
HIGHLY O
recommended O
. O

You O
’re O
immunocompromised O
and O
vaccines O
can O
help O
protect O
you O
from O
diseases O
that O
are O
more O
dangerous O
for O
immunocompromised O
people O
. O


Also O
, O
research O
shows O
that O
inactivity O
is O
more O
of O
a O
risk O
than O
activity O
, O
with O
the O
caveat O
of O
listening O
to O
your O
body O
. O

But O
assuming O
you O
are O
, O
there O
’s O
no O
reason O
to O
avoid O
any O
kind O
of O
exercise O
. O


In O
Australia O
we O
have O
to O
try O
humira B-DRUG
first O
before O
stelara B-DRUG
, O
( O
due O
to O
cost O
I O
assume O
) O
. O

I O
just O
failed O
humira B-DRUG
after O
a O
year O
or O
so O
and O
started O
stelara B-DRUG
last O
week O
. O

I O
do O
nt O
think O
it O
matters O
which O
order O
you O
try O
them O
though O
. O

The O
humira B-DRUG
pen O
was O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
fortnightly O
but O
stelara B-DRUG
is O
a O
jab O
every O
second O
month O
, O
so O
less O
jabs O
overall O
. O


remicade B-DRUG
has O
worked O
wonders O
for O
me O
, O
humira B-DRUG
( O
not O
sure O
if O
this O
is O
a O
biologic O
tbh O
) O
actually O
made O
me O
worse O
. O


The O
root O
cause O
will O
be O
whatever O
also O
causes O
Crohn O
's O
flares B-ADR
, O
as O
they O
're O
connected- O
think O
of O
this O
as O
Crohn O
's O
in O
the O
eyeball O
! O

  O
Could O
be O
stress O
, O
could O
be O
diet O
, O
could O
be O
many O
things O
. O

  O
Is O
he O
taking O
a O
biologic O
for O
his O
Crohn O
's O
? O

  O
Our O
chronic O
uveitis B-ADR
patients O
are O
often O
started O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
even O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
Crohn O
's O
, O
because O
it O
's O
an O
inflammatory B-ADR
condition O
in O
itself O
. O


I O
also O
tried O
humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
for O
me O
either O
. O

I O
then O
started O
taking O
xeljanz B-DRUG
10mgs O
twice O
a O
day O
. O

It O
made O
me O
so O
sick B-ADR
! O

Extreme O
muscle O
and O
joint O
pain B-ADR
, O
debilitating O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
it O
amplified O
my O
seasonal B-ADR
allergies I-ADR
and O
thought O
I O
had O
covid O
or O
bronchitis B-ADR
. O

It O
sucks O
because O
my O
gastrointestinal O
doctor O
said O
according O
to O
my O
lab O
results O
it O
was O
helping O
. O


I O
hope O
I O
did O
n't O
scare O
you O
, O
I O
'm O
probably O
in O
the O
minority O
of O
such O
ridiculous O
side O
effects O
. O


Good O
luck O
! O

Hope O
xeljanz B-DRUG
is O
the O
one O
that O
helps O
you O
get O
healthy O

Coffee O
might O
just O
be O
me O
... O
I O
drank O
coffee O
for O
years O
and O
years O
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
catching O
up O
to O
me O
. O

I O
still O
drink O
coffee O
maybe O
just O
2 O
- O
3x O
a O
week O
. O

I O
switched O
to O
drinking O
Green O
Tea O
and O
Black O
Tea O
but O
it O
was O
the O
same O
time O
when O
I O
just O
started O
taking O
Vitamin O
D O
, O
Zinc O
, O
and O
Biotin O
. O

I O
still O
think O
Vitamin O
D O
was O
what O
helped O
reduce O
my O
flares B-ADR
. O

Otezla B-DRUG
, O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
etc O
... O
all O
these O
drugs O
are O
just O
hidden O
and O
suppressing O
what O
our O
bodies O
are O
telling O
us O
. O

Definitely O
watch O
your O
diet O
, O
eat O
healthier O
, O
exercise O
3 O
- O
4x O
a O
week O
, O
and O
continue O
taking O
your O
vitamins O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

Our O
gut O
biome O
is O
a O
complete O
mess O
. O

But O
we O
're O
all O
here O
trying O
to O
find O
a O
holistic O
solutions O
first O
. O

☺ O

Well O
done O
my O
friend O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
needles O
either O
and O
understand O
how O
proud O
you O
feel O
when O
you O
fight O
through O
that O
fear O
and O
get O
it O
done O
. O

Proud O
of O
you O
. O



 O
I O
will O
say O
... O
I O
did O
not O
like O
those O
pens O
at O
all O
. O

That O
popping O
sound O
. O

The O
way O
it O
forces O
the O
med O
into O
you O
quickly O
. O

The O
pain B-ADR
. O

I O
'd O
have O
a O
welt B-ADR
for O
a O
day O
or O
two O
afterwards O
. O

I O
switched O
to O
the O
syringes O
and O
it O
was O
a O
game O
- O
changer O
for O
me O
. O

I O
could O
slowly O
meter O
the O
med O
in O
. O

No O
pain B-ADR
and O
no O
more O
bruising B-ADR
. O

Seriously O
. O

It O
was O
a O
night O
and O
day O
difference O
for O
me O
. O

I O
hate O
needles O
, O
but O
giving O
the O
injection O
myself O
was O
super O
easy O
. O

If O
the O
pens O
are O
working O
for O
you O
, O
keep O
at O
it O
though O
. O

Just O
know O
the O
syringes O
can O
be O
a O
less O
painful O
option O
. O



 O
Hope O
Humira B-DRUG
keeps O
you O
in O
remission O
for O
many O
years O
to O
come O
! O


Sorry O
to O
interrupt O
but O
hold O
it O
right O
there O
. O

 


 O
I O
used O
to O
have O
Guttate B-ADR
and O
like O
you O
was O
quite O
affected O
by O
it O
. O

Before O
you O
go O
on O
putting O
Biologics O
into O
your O
system O
you O
might O
wanna O
just O
try O
the O
Phototherapy O
. O

It O
's O
been O
over O
a O
year O
since O
I O
stopped O
mine O
and O
most O
of O
the O
spots O
never O
returned O
( O
except O
for O
a O
few O
stubborn O
ones O
that O
did O
n't O
go O
away O
with O
photo O
, O
and O
I O
just O
use O
topical O
to O
control O
) O
. O

 


 O
It O
saves O
you O
alot O
of O
money O
simply O
by O
not O
going O
biologics O
. O

Biologics O
have O
a O
range O
from O
generics O
to O
the O
genuine O
article O
, O
the O
generics O
are O
cheaper O
but O
some O
of O
the O
manufacturers O
cut O
corners O
in O
areas O
like O
the O
injection O
pen O
and O
some O
people O
on O
Amgevita O
reported O
having O
reactions B-ADR
to O
the O
injection O
site O
they O
did O
nt O
have O
with O
it O
's O
gen O
counterpart O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

 


 O
Go O
with O
photo O
, O
eat O
a O
balanced O
diet O
, O
maybe O
throw O
in O
Vitamin O
D O
sup O
if O
you O
are O
rarely O
out O
in O
the O
sun O
and O
just O
see O
how O
it O
goes O
. O

Biologics O
are O
amazing O
if O
you O
are O
covered O
, O
but O
if O
you O
are O
n't O
it O
kills O
your O
finances O
pretty O
fast O
. O


my O
Rheumatologist O
wo O
nt O
prescribe O
enbril B-DRUG
because O
of O
the O
increased O
cancer B-ADR
risks O
vs O
humira B-DRUG
. O

  O
i O
have O
n’t O
researched O
it O
. O


Talk O
with O
the O
Abbvie O
nurse O
ambassador O
, O
get O
the O
copay O
assistance O
card O
. O

I O
pay O
$ O
5 O
per O
order O
of O
6 O

 O
My O
injections O
are O
every O
14 O
days O
, O
not O
weekly O
. O



 O
My O
Leflunomide B-DRUG
worked O
well O
for O
a O
few O
years O
before O
it O
started O
reducing O
its O
effectiveness O
, O
started O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
in O
March O
of O
2021 O
. O



 O
Watch O

Mine O

up O
like O
a O
rocket O
around O
the O
fifth O
or O
sixth O
injection O

Definitely O
looks O
like O
HS O
and O
those O
are O
all O
hot O
spots O
where O
HS O
occurs O
. O

I O
would O
get O
them O
typically O
in O
my O
groin O
area O
( O
male O
) O
and O
on O
my O
legs O
and O
under O

Removed O

from O
my O

aspririn B-DRUG
mixed O
with O
honey O
to O
rub O
on O
my O
spots O

it O
helps O
with O
scaring B-ADR

flare B-ADR

 O
My O
flare B-ADR
ups I-ADR
have B-ADR
nt I-ADR
stopped I-ADR

getting O
maybe O
10 O
flare B-ADR
ups I-ADR

3 O
a O
year O
and O
they O
are O
WAY O
less O
bad O
than O
what O
they O
were O
. O

My O
last O
one O
was O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
after O
about O
7 O
months O
for O
no O
flare B-ADR
ups I-ADR
and O
it O

really O
bad O
and O
I O
had O
to O
get O
surgery O
at O
the O
ER O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
what O
i O

a O
god O
send O
. O



 O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
try O
Humira B-DRUG
as O
its O
a O
immune O
system O
depressant O
and O
I O
am O
afraid O
of O
an O
immune O
system O
depressant O
while O
covid O
was O
and O
still O
is O
going O

humira B-DRUG
. O


They O
told O
me O
it O
was O
pretty O
mild O
crohns O
. O

It O
helped O
a O
good O
bit O
. O

It O
maybe O
took O
2 O
months O
to O
fully O
work O

Pain B-ADR
and O
urges O
went O
mostly O
away O
. O

Except O
during O
stressful O
situations O
. O



 O
When O
my O
doctor O
told O
me O
that O
steroids O
are O
only O
a O
short O
term O
solution O
and O
I O
had O
to O
go O
back O
on O
lialda B-DRUG
, O
I O
definitely O
was O
not O
happy O
. O



 O
I O
went O
on O
here O
I O
scoured O
the O
posts O
and O
most O
people O
here O
recommend O
going O
on O
biologics O
asap O
. O

You O
’re O
stuck O
w O
this O
decease O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life O
. O

Might O
as O
well O
get O
ahead O
of O
it O
before O
it O
does O
any O
serious O
damage O
. O



 O
Starting O
with O
weaker O
drugs O
and O
working O
your O
way O
to O
more O
potent O
drugs O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
old O
school O
approach O
. O



 O
While O
tackling O
it O
right O
away O
seems O
new O
school O
? O

Idk O
that O
’s O
just O
what O
I O
read O
on O
here O
tbh O
. O

Which O
I O
understand O
given O
the O
potential O
severity O
of O
this O
disease O
. O



 O
I O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
2 O
weeks O
ago O
and O
it O
’s O
the O
best O
i O
ve O
ever O
felt O
since O
starting O
to O
deal O
with O
crohns O
3 O
years O
ago O
. O



 O
No O
pain B-ADR
almost O
normal O
digestion O
. O

My O
body O
still O
does O
n’t O
like O
certain O
food O
but O
everything O
is O
more O
manageable O
. O



 O
I O
will O
say O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
tapered O
off O
the O
second O
week O
but O
I O
take O
my O
next O
dose O
tomorrow O
. O



 O
I O
’ve O
also O
read O
it O
take O
awhile O
to O
fully O
kick O
in O
. O

 

 O
Biologics O
, O
from O
my O
understanding O
are O
the O
ultimate O
hope O
for O
Crohns O
patients O
. O

From O
what O
I O
’ve O
read O
on O
here O
, O
they O
work O
anywhere O
from O
a O
year O
to O
10 O
+ O
years O
. O

And O
if O
a O
biologic O
stops O
working O
, O
you O
rotate O
to O
another O
. O





 O
Just O
my O
2 O
cents O
. O

I O
definitely O
do O
n’t O
have O
the O
experience O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
have O
but O
crohns O
has O
negatively O
effected O
my O
life O
for O
years O
and O
this O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
’ve O
felt O
any O
type O
of O
real O
relief O
. O

Honestly O
I O
was O
getting O
depressed B-ADR
before O
all O
this O
. O

Being O
in O
constant O
pain B-ADR
takes O
a O
toll O
on O
you O
after O
awhile O
. O

Talk O
to O
your O
doctor O
but O
I O
highly O
recommend O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

The O
Humira B-DRUG
specialist O
has O
been O
super O
nice O
and O
talked O
me O
through O
everything O
. O


I O
know O
that O
in O
certain O
cases O
my O
GI O
doctor O
sometimes O
lets O
his O
patients O
switch O
from O
Inflectra B-DRUG
to O
Entyvio B-DRUG
, O
or O
Inflectra B-DRUG
to O
humira B-DRUG
, O
etc O
. O

depending O
on O
their O
personal O
situation O
. O

Some O
people O
do O
what O
you O
are O
describing O
and O
are O
successful O
, O
but O
its O
not O
guaranteed O
. O

Some O
doctors O
allow O
it O
and O
some O
are O
against O
it O
. O

You O
just O
need O
to O
find O
a O
doctor O
who O
will O
let O
you O
, O
I O
suppose O
. O


For O
me O
it O
took O
a O
few O
of O
the O
12 O
week O
injections O
to O
clear O
me O
up O
. O

But O
then O
I O
started O
getting O
flairs B-ADR
in O
my O
armpits O
which O
I O
had O
never O
had O
before O
I O
started O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
. O

So O
I O
use O
topicals O
intermittently O
there O
. O



 O
I O
also O
now O
get O
not O
quite O
psoriasis B-ADR
but O
redness B-ADR
/ O
almost O
like O
burns B-ADR
on O
my O
face O
around O
my O
mouth O
and O
under O
my O
eyes O
. O

I O
now O
use O
a O
cream O
and O
an O
ointment O
on O
my O
face O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
very O
intermittently O
. O

It O
took O
about O
8 O
months O
for O
me O
to O
find O
a O
regiment O
that O
cleared O
my O
face O
and O
keeps O
it O
clear O
enough O
where O
I O
do O
n’t O
have O
to O
use O
the O
treatment O
daily O
. O



 O
I O
do O
n’t O
think O
I O
’ll O
ever O
get O
to O
a O
place O
where O
I O
am O
fully O
clear O
, O
but O
the O
shot O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
work O
into O
your O
life O
- O
once O
every O
12 O
weeks O
instead O
of O
every O
other O
week O
- O
and O
I O
’ve O
never O
even O
come O
close O
( O
yet O
) O
to O
having O
a O
staph O
infection B-ADR
like O
when O
I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
I O
’ve O
been O
on O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
for O
almost O
2 O
years O
. O


Yeah O
that O
has O
to O
be O
it O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
have O
been O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
since O
November O
2021 O
and O
these O
new O
reactions B-ADR
are O
new O
. O

We O
talked O
about O
me O
switching O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
so O
I O
hope O
all O
that O
goes O
well O
. O

How O
is O
Humira B-DRUG
treating O
u O
now O
? O

I O
hope O
its O
going O
well O
for O
u O
:) O

Be O
upfront O
with O
the O
primary O
and O
GI O
doctor O
about O
your O
symptoms O
and O
how O
it O
interferes O
with O
your O
life O
( O
if O
it O
does O
) O
. O

If O
you O
're O
flaring O
you O
may O
be O
put O
on O
Prednisone B-DRUG
for O
a O
while O
to O
get O
it O
under O
control O
but O
make O
sure O
you O
are O
working O
with O
a O
GI O
doctor O
for O
a O
long O
term O
plan O
. O

Do O
n't O
stay O
on O
Prednisone B-DRUG
long O
term O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
! O

People O
tend O
to O
start O
with O
mesalamine B-DRUG
or O
similar O
medicine O
. O

Sometimes O
mercaptopurine B-DRUG
is O
the O
next O
step O
while O
other O
doctors O
skip O
to O
biologics O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Hope O
that O
helps O
. O


my O
medical B-DRUG
marijuana I-DRUG
dr O
told O
me O
to O
use O
edibles B-DRUG
and O
to O
never O
smoke O
or O
vap O
  O
because O
i O
am O
at O
a O
greater O
risk O
of O
bronchial O
and O
lung O
infections B-ADR
due O
to O
being O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
fact O
that O
smoking O
/ O
vaping O
is O
horrible O
to O
begin O
with O

Been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
8 O
month O
. O

It O
’s O
been O
amazing O
at O
clearing O
up O
my O
iritis B-ADR
, O
back B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
neck B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

I O
’m O
pain B-ADR
free O
. O

I O
gave O
away O
my O
chickens O
, O
wash O
my O
hands O
more O
frequently O
and O
try O
to O
avoid O
sick B-ADR
people O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
I O
do O
yard O
work O
, O
go O
to O
movies O
and O
concerts O
without O
a O
mask O
and O
hug O
my O
dog O
. O

I O
had O
several O
immunocompromised O
nurses O
tell O
me O
to O
“ O
just O
live O
your O
life O
! O

” O

I O
’ve O
had O
severe O
ulcerative B-ADR
colitis I-ADR
for O
4 O
years O
now O
, O
2 O
of O
which O
I O
have O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
( O
miracle O
drug O
by O
the O
way O
, O
10/10 O
recommend O
) O
. O

I O
initially O
started O
on O
mesalamine B-DRUG
and O
it O
had O
little O
to O
no O
affect O
on O
my O
symptoms O
. O

Still O
saw O
severe O
amounts O
of O
blood B-ADR
in I-ADR
my I-ADR
stool I-ADR
, O
and O
felt O
significant O
barriers O
to O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
due O
to O
frequent O
bathroom O
trips O
. O

It O
did O
n’t O
work O
at O
all O
for O
me O
, O
but O
again O
, O
I O
have O
very O
severe O
colitis B-ADR
and O
for O
people O
with O
mild O
colitis B-ADR
I O
have O
heard O
great O
things O
. O

Best O
of O
luck O
! O


I O
'm O
on O
Simponi B-DRUG
at O
the O
moment O
and O
was O
previously O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
/ O
Amgevita B-DRUG
. O



 O
During O
covid O
, O
we O
were O
careful O
, O
especially O
before O
the O
vaccines O
. O



 O
In O
April O
, O
we O
ended O
up O
travelling O
and O
came O
home O
with O
covid O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
it O
was O
a O
mild O
case O
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
Paxlovid B-DRUG
. O



 O
I O
do O
avoid O
sick B-ADR
people O
, O
as O
my O
rheumatologist O
has O
said O
that O
if O
I O
am O
sick B-ADR
, O
to O
pause O
my O
biologic O
. O



 O
As O
far O
as O
general O
sickness B-ADR
goes O
, O
I O
wa O
son O
Humira B-DRUG
when O
I O
last O
worked O
in O
an O
office O
and O
I O
was O
sick B-ADR
far O
less O
often O
than O
when O
I O
was O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
( O
colds O
mostly O
) O
. O

I O
also O
worked O
in O
a O
cube O
farm O
, O
so O
colds O
spread O
like O
wildfire O
on O
a O
good O
day O
. O


It O
takes O
some O
time O
. O

I O
went O
completely O
off O
medication O
and O
went O
into O
remission O
. O

15 O
years O
later O
I O
just O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
maintenance O
reasons O
. O

Had O
some O
inflammation B-ADR
around O
the O
incision O
. O

Did O
they O
take O
your O
gall O
bladder O
? O

And O
how O
much O
did O
they O
take O
out O
? O

Only O
if O
you O
feel O
like O
sharing O
. O


They O
're O
also O
referred O
to O
as O
biologocs O
, O
and O
they O
cause O
a O
reaction B-ADR
in O
your O
immune O
system O
that O
greatly O
reduces O
inflammation B-ADR
. O

They O
're O
injections O
that O
you O
do O
at O
home O
( O
usually O
2x O
/ O
month O
) O
and O
they O
are O
really O
effective O
, O
but O
they O
can O
lower O
your O
immune O
system O
and O
make O
you O
more O
prone O
to O
infections B-ADR
. O

I O
took O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
several O
years O
and O
had O
great O
results O
, O
but O
thanks O
to O
a O
change O
in O
insurance O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
it O
. O

When O
I O
was O
finally O
able O
to O
get O
back O
on O
it O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
as O
effective O
. O


Thanks O
for O
your O
reply O
! O

I O
’ve O
only O
been O
on O
weekly O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
4 O
weeks O
but O
not O
seen O
any O
decline O
in O
symptoms O
so O
my O
doctor O
wanted O
to O
introduce O
me O
to O
this O
medication O
as O
an O
immunosuppressant O
to O
see O
if O
it O
helps O
me O
keep O
Humira B-DRUG
in O
my O
system O
longer O
because O
he O
thinks O
it O
’s O
too O
early O
to O
take O
me O
off O
Humira B-DRUG
completely O
yet O
. O

We O
are O
gon O
na O
trial O
this O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
before O
I O
do O
more O
tests O
and O
then O
pending O
that O
, O
I O
’ll O
be O
doing O
another O
scope O
and O
switching O
to O
stelara B-DRUG
. O

How O
have O
you O
found O
stelara B-DRUG
compared O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
so O
far O
? O

In O
terms O
of O
the O
injection O
aswell O
, O
is O
it O
as O
mild O
as O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
inject O
? O


Symptoms O
are O
not O
the O
full O
story O
. O

You O
’re O
seeing O
the O
results O
of O
years O
of O
symptomless O
inflammation B-ADR
now O
in O
the O
polyps B-ADR
. O

Even O
assuming O
you O
somehow O
manage O
to O
continue O
to O
avoid O
a O
flare B-ADR
, O
it O
’s O
clear O
the O
inflammation B-ADR
is O
still O
doing O
lasting O
damage B-ADR
to O
your O
colon O
and O
has O
been O
for O
awhile O
. O



 O
Polyps B-ADR
are O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
and O
only O
warnings O
you O
’ll O
get O
of O
potential O
colon B-ADR
cancer I-ADR
. O

You O
need O
to O
reduce O
inflammation B-ADR
and O
biologics O
are O
a O
good O
way O
to O
do O
it O
in O
a O
way O
that O
treats O
the O
problem O
at O
its O
source O
. O



 O
Almost O
all O
biologics O
are O
very O
safe O
and O
have O
minimal O
impact O
on O
your O
life O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
basically O
no O
real O
risk O
of O
causing O
cancer B-ADR
when O
not O
crossed O
with O
the O
wrong O
meds O
and O
I O
believe O
most O
others O
have O
a O
similar O
if O
not O
better O
safety O
profile O
. O



 O
The O
risks O
of O
uncontrolled O
inflammation B-ADR
though O
are O
certain O
and O
immeasurably O
higher O
than O
biologics O
for O
developing O
cancer B-ADR
. O

Every O
year O
you O
live O
with O
an O
inflamed B-ADR
colon O
increases O
your O
risk O
of O
cancer B-ADR
significantly O
and O
you O
’ve O
probably O
been O
living O
with O
one O
for O
at O
least O
the O
better O
part O
of O
a O
decade O
. O



 O
You O
can O
keep O
fucking O
around O
thinking O
you O
know O
better O
than O
your O
doctor O
and O
find O
out O
when O
you O
find O
out O
you O
have O
stage O
3 O
cancer B-ADR
or O
need O
to O
remove O
your O
colon O
. O

Or O
you O
can O
listen O
to O
somebody O
who O
studies O
colons O
for O
a O
living O
. O

If O
mesalamine B-DRUG
was O
enough O
then O
you O
would O
n’t O
have O
inflammation B-ADR
. O

Your O
doctor O
is O
not O
jumping O
to O
biologics O
here O
, O
it O
’s O
been O
16 O
years O
of O
seeing O
if O
this O
lighter O
solution O
works O
for O
you O
and O
it O
’s O
clearly O
not O
. O

UC O
is O
not O
treatable O
with O
natural O
remedies O
. O

Natural O
remedies O
just O
help O
mask O
or O
delay O
the O
problem O
. O



 O
Sorry O
to O
be O
harsh O
but O
you O
seem O
to O
have O
your O
mind O
made O
up O
already O
when O
this O
post O
was O
made O
but O
that O
short O
- O
sightedness O
is O
putting O
your O
health O
at O
serious O
risk O
here O
. O

A O
second O
opinion O
is O
fine O
but O
do O
n’t O
look O
for O
one O
that O
just O
validates O
your O
’s O
. O


I O
'm O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
( O
over O
6 O
years O
) O
and O
very O
hairy O
. O

  O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
bald O
spots O
show O
up O
in O
that O
time O
. O

  O
How O
are O
your O
iron O
levels O
? O


First O
- O
you O
are O
amazing O
and O
absolutely O
worthy O
of O
love O
and O
affection O
. O

Your O
health O
and O
body O
type O
do O
n’t O
dictate O
your O
worthiness O
. O



 O
Second O
- O
My O
HS O
was O
far O
worse O
when O
I O
was O
conventionally O
thin O
. O

* O
Far O
* O
worse O
. O

Weight O
has O
never O
really O
been O
a O
verifiable O
factor O
for O
me O
. O



 O
Third O
- O
It O
’s O
a O
goddamn O
shame O
that O
treatment O
for O
this O
is O
such O
a O
privilege O
. O

I O
’m O
in O
the O
US O
, O
I O
’m O
not O
sure O
where O
you O
’re O
located O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
Medicaid O
partially O
due O
to O
my O
income O
and O
partially O
due O
to O
my O
health O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
my O
doctor O
RXd O
me O
Humira B-DRUG
made O
me O
essentially O
a O
shoe O
in O
. O

I O
know O
each O
state O
is O
different O
and O
has O
different O
requirements O
but O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
US O
it O
would O
n’t O
hurt O
to O
look O
into O
it O
if O
you O
have O
n’t O
already O
. O



 O
I O
would O
also O
be O
more O
than O
happy O
to O
share O
what O
works O
for O
me O
, O
if O
you O
’d O
like O
. O

If O
not O
, O
that O
’s O
fine O
too O
. O



 O
This O
card O
we O
’ve O
been O
dealt O
in O
life O
is O
horrific O
and O
upsetting O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

I O
’m O
sorry O
you O
’re O
in O
this O
club O
with O
us O
🖤 O

Athletic O
Greens O
and O
high O
strength O
probiotics B-DRUG
( O
VSL#3 O
) O
come O
to O
mind O
immediately O
. O

I O
've O
tried O
a O
bunch O
of O
random O
vitamins O
that O
did O
n't O
significantly O
improve O
my O
symptoms O
, O
some O
light O
to O
moderate O
relief O
, O
nothing O
I O
'd O
jump O
up O
and O
down O
about O
. O

I O
've O
started O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
not O
sold O
on O
it O
yet O
. O

I O
read O
something O
about O
" O
Apigenin B-DRUG
" O
that O
sounded O
interesting O
. O

Bout O
to O
order O
some O
and O
try O
that O
out O
. O

Would O
try O
CBD B-DRUG
suppositories O
. O


I O
am O
31 O
, O
diagnosed O
at O
30 O
but O
had O
pain B-ADR
for O
years O
before O
diagnosis O
. O

It O
really O
is O
a O
grieving O
process O
. O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
one O
year O
ago O
and O
I O
still O
have O
so O
many O
ups O
and O
downs O
to O
this O
day O
and O
I O
suspect O
I O
will O
for O
a O
while O
. O

I O
also O
have O
not O
had O
a O
medicine O
that O
has O
worked O
for O
me O
. O

I O
tried O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
for O
3 O
months O
at O
a O
mid O
- O
level O
dose O
and O
saw O
no O
positive O
effects O
, O
only O
a O
lot O
of O
bad O
side O
effects O
( O
hair B-ADR
loss I-ADR
, O
mood B-ADR
change I-ADR
, O
weight B-ADR
gain I-ADR
) O
, O
so O
me O
and O
my O
Rheumy O
decided O
it O
was O
best O
for O
me O
to O
go O
off O
of O
it O
, O
instead O
of O
increase O
the O
dose O
, O
because O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
. O

She O
recommended O
Humira B-DRUG
next O
for O
me O
. O

I O
am O
still O
debating O
that O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
( O
self O
injection O
) O
is O
what O
I O
had O
reactions O
, O
side O
effects O
too O

The O
documentation O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
literally O
says O
not O
to O
continue O
with O
the O
medication O
if O
this O
happens O
. O

Talk O
to O
your O
doc O
immediately O
! O

! O

! O

! O

! O


I O
was O
n’t O
on O
otezla B-DRUG
- O
i O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
had O
negative O
side O
effects O
but O
pushed O
through O
for O
a O
few O
years O
until O
I O
started O
personally O
deciding O
I O
could O
n’t O
deal O
with O
them O
anymore O
. O

I O
started O
to O
ween O
myself O
off O
of O
humira B-DRUG
and O
extending O
the O
doses O
to O
see O
what O
would O
happen O
. O

Multiple O
years O
later O
I O
’m O
happy O
to O
say O
I O
’m O
still O
psoriasis B-ADR
free O
( O
95 O
% O
today O
, O
100 O
% O
on O
humira B-DRUG
) O
and O
have O
not O
taken O
humira B-DRUG
in O
years O
. O

My O
case O
was O
severe O
with O
diagnosed O
99 O
% O
of O
my O
body O
covered O
and O
I O
have O
guttate B-ADR
. O

My O
only O
issues O
today O
are O
my O
scalp O
and O
every O
few O
months O
I O
get O
a O
spot O
here O
or O
there O
- O
instantly O
treat O
it O
with O
topicals O
- O
and O
I O
’m O
good O
to O
go O
. O


Ya O
I O
am O
actually O
switching O
doctors O
bc O
I O
told O
him O
beginning O
of O
June O
, O
that O
I O
was O
going O
backwards O
and O
flaring O
. O

We O
both O
thought O
it O
was O
bc O
of O
Covid O
and O
which O
I O
think O
it O
is O
bc O
I O
had O
it O
twice.meds O
were O
working O
pretty O
good O
. O

Tried O
me O
on O
a O
steroid O
and O
powder O
both O
did O
n’t O
work O
. O

Does O
n’t O
want O
to O
up O
meds O
and O
basically O
told O
me O
to O
wait O
till O
sept O
my O
next O
appt O
. O

Luckily O
they O
had O
a O
cancellation O
is O
able O
to O
squeeze O
me O
in O
8/31(sarcasm O
) O
I O
have O
told O
them O
prob O
5x O
this O
stuff O
is O
n’t O
working O
either O
change O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
weekly O
instead O
of O
bi O
weekly O
or O
switch O
meds O
. O

In O
my O
head O
i O
m O
saying O
you O
do O
n’t O
have O
an O
emergency O
appt O
between O
mid O
June O
and O
end O
of O
august O
you O
ca O
n’t O
squeeze O
me O
jn O

Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Actemra B-DRUG
, O
Remicade B-DRUG
, O
are O
all O
solid O
starts O
. O

Enbrel B-DRUG
was O
a O
wonder O
drug O
for O
me O
, O
and O
Actemra B-DRUG
has O
been O
too O
. O

I O
went O
from O
basically O
paralyzed O
to O
doing O
cartwheels O
in O
a O
matter O
of O
weeks O
. O




 O
I O
underwent O
* O
years O
* O
of O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
during O
my O
childhood O
& O
teens O
, O
which O
did O
a O
number O
on O
my O
liver O
& O
stomach O
. O

So O
, O
I O
rarely O
drink O
; O
maybe O
half O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
2 O
- O
3 O
times O
per O
year O
at O
special O
occasions O
( O
i.e. O
wedding O
, O
etc O
) O
. O



 O
Biologics O
, O
at O
least O
in O
my O
experience O
, O
have O
far O
fewer O
side O
effects O
, O
compared O
to O
meds O
like O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
. O

Kids O
are O
doable O
/ O
an O
option O
if O
you O
want O
, O
I O
think O
it O
just O
requires O
extra O
coordination O
with O
Rheumatology O
, O
OB O
/ O
GYN O
, O
either O
stopping O
or O
temporarily O
halting O
meds O
in O
the O
months O
or O
year O
leading O
up O
to O
conception O
, O
may O
require O
modification O
or O
suspension O
of O
meds O
during O
pregnancy O
, O
and O
a O
number O
of O
DMARDs O
are O
n't O
safe O
following O
pregnancy O
either O
, O
i.e. O
during O
breastfeeding O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
kids O
( O
I O
'm O
27F O
) O
, O
so O
this O
is O
all O
just O
based O
on O
what O
I O
've O
heard O
from O
other O
women O
with O
RA O
, O
and O
from O
the O
high O
- O
risk O
ob O
/ O
gyn O
I O
have O
( O
I O
've O
also O
got O
GYN O
issues O
, O
hence O
having O
a O
high O
- O
risk O
  O
GYN O
) O
. O



 O
Let O
me O
know O
if O
you O
have O
any O
other O
questions O
. O


I O
had O
it O
prior O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
was O
told O
it O
was O
seborrheic B-ADR
dermatitis I-ADR
. O

Cleared O
up O
with O
a O
medicated O
shampoo O
. O

Definitely O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
hair B-ADR
thinning I-ADR
... O
I've O
been O
on O
it O
for O
almost O
6 O
months O
and O
Mtx B-DRUG
for O
over O
a O
year O

over O
the O
course O
of O
16 O
years O
with O
HS O
, O
the O
best O
combo O
treatment O
I O
've O
found O
for O
myself O
is O
Stelara B-DRUG
( O
similar O
to O
remicade B-DRUG
and O
humira B-DRUG
) O
and O
a O
vegan O
diet O
. O

I O
happened O
to O
switch O
to O
both O
of O
these O
methods O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
so O
the O
impact O
of O
each O
is O
unclear O
to O
me O
. O


Thank O
you O
! O

If O
you O
ever O
want O
to O
DM O
me O
for O
someone O
to O
talk O
to O
, O
I O
’m O
here O
! O

I O
’ve O
struggled O
with O
my O
mental O
health O
since O
being O
diagnosed O
. O

Plus O
having O
a O
new O
baby O
and O
when O
I O
was O
9 O
months O
pregnant O
my O
house O
/ O
car O
was O
destroyed O
by O
a O
freak O
tornado O
and O
we O
lost O
95 O
% O
of O
everything O
we O
ever O
owned O
. O

So O
, O
yah O
… O
it O
’s O
been O
a O
real O
fun O
2 O
years O
for O
me O
. O



 O
But O
I O
’m O
doing O
so O
much O
better O
now O
, O
I O
just O
had O
an O
injection O
today O
and O
of O
course O
, O
some O
days O
are O
a O
lot O
harder O
to O
give O
myself O
the O
shot O
but O
I O
have O
a O
great O
husband O
who O
will O
give O
me O
my O
injection O
on O
days O
I O
do O
n’t O
have O
the O
mental O
fortitude O
to O
do O
it O
. O



 O
I O
do O
n’t O
have O
much O
else O
of O
a O
support O
system O
and O
do O
n’t O
personally O
know O
anyone O
else O
with O
RA O
to O
talk O
to O
about O
things O
, O
so O
sometimes O
, O
idk O
what O
’s O
normal O
or O
what O
to O
expect O
. O



 O
I O
am O
so O
happy O
you O
’re O
getting O
relief O
also O
and O
that O
humira B-DRUG
is O
working O
for O
you O
! O

You O
’re O
a O
strong O
person O
and O
I O
’m O
proud O
of O
you O
! O


For O
me O
adalimumab B-DRUG
worked O
very O
quick O
but O
that O
was O
with O
a O
loading O
dose O
( O
4 O
injections O
, O
two O
weeks O
later O
another O
2 O
injections O
then O
1 O
injection O
every O
2 O
weeks O
) O
, O
if O
your O
infusions O
are O
n’t O
that O
often O
and O
you O
did O
n’t O
get O
a O
loading O
dose O
it O
may O
take O
a O
little O
while O
, O
I O
think O
they O
usually O
give O
it O
at O
least O
6 O
months O
to O
see O
if O
it O
works O
but O
it O
would O
be O
worth O
asking O
your O
doctor O
. O



 O
You O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O
once O
a O
week O
? O

That O
really O
is O
n’t O
healthy O
, O
are O
you O
severely O
constipated B-ADR
? O

They O
can O
maybe O
give O
you O
something O
to O
help O
you O
go O
more O
regularly O
, O
a O
weeks O
worth O
stored O
and O
waiting O
to O
come O
out O
ca O
n’t O
be O
good O
for O
you O
. O


I O
’ve O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
before O
and O
I O
worked O
in O
a O
daycare O
. O

I O
’m O
sure O
you O
may O
know O
but O
kids O
are O
factories O
for O
germs O
and O
I O
only O
got O
sick B-ADR
once O
. O

However O
, O
it O
did O
take O
me O
longer O
than O
normal O
to O
get O
better O
. O

I O
’ve O
always O
had O
a O
shitty O
immune O
system O
so O
getting O
sick B-ADR
is O
a O
pastime O
of O
mine O
, O
but O
I O
made O
the O
mistake O
of O
doing O
my O
shot O
when O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
better O
. O

I O
most O
definitely O
was O
not O
better O
and O
by O
doing O
my O
shot O
, O
I O
extended O
the O
length O
of O
my O
time O
being O
sick B-ADR
by O
a O
whole O
month O
. O



 O
Alongside O
the O
obvious O
talk O
to O
your O
doctor O
response O
, O
I O
also O
recommend O
talking O
to O
a O
humira B-DRUG
nurse O
ambassador O
. O

They O
help O
you O
get O
set O
up O
with O
insurance O
and O
getting O
your O
shots O
and O
they O
can O
also O
help O
with O
advice O
and O
answering O
any O
questions O
you O
have O
. O

My O
nurse O
was O
so O
helpful O
and O
so O
nice O
to O
me O
the O
whole O
time O
I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
, O
so O
I O
highly O
recommend O
utilizing O
that O
program O
if O
you O
choose O
to O
use O
it O
! O



 O
Other O
than O
that O
I O
’ve O
been O
fine O
since O
, O
humira B-DRUG
was O
so O
helpful O
for O
my O
inflammation B-ADR
, O
and O
I O
got O
two O
covid O
shots O
while O
on O
it O
and O
I O
felt O
protected O
. O

I O
’m O
also O
extremely O
vigilant O
with O
wearing O
a O
mask O
in O
public O
, O
and O
I O
try O
to O
steer O
clear O
of O
people O
who O
are O
toddler O
coughing B-ADR
in O
public O
. O

Good O
luck O
! O


The O
Adalimumab B-DRUG
injections O
are O
a O
biologic O
immune O
modulating O
medication O
that O
I O
take O
for O
Crohn O
’s O
disease O
. O

It O
mostly O
keeps O
my O
Crohn O
’s O
symptoms O
under O
control O
but O
due O
to O
having O
both O
Crohn O
’s O
and O
endometriosis B-ADR
+ O
multiple O
surgeries O
from O
the O
endo B-ADR
I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
adhesions B-ADR
and O
scar B-ADR
tissue I-ADR
that O
cause O
the O
pain B-ADR

He O
ca O
n’t O
take O
humira B-DRUG
if O
he O
’s O
allergic B-ADR
to O
humira B-DRUG

Yep O
. O

Our O
insurance O
at O
that O
time O
covered O
it O
, O
but O
that O
's O
what O
it O
actually O
costs O
thanks O
to O
our O
shitty O
systems O
. O

Our O
insurance O
changed O
at O
one O
point O
, O
and O
even O
though O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
was O
working O
great O
for O
her O
, O
she O
had O
to O
change O
to O
something O
else O
that O
did O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
because O
the O
new O
insurance O
would O
n't O
cover O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

She O
's O
gone O
through O
like O
3 O
or O
4 O
other O
biologics O
, O
and O
none O
of O
them O
have O
worked O
as O
well O
as O
Humira B-DRUG
did O
. O


It O
may O
start O
working O
for O
you O
within O
a O
few O
days O
, O
or O
it O
may O
take O
a O
3 O
or O
4 O
months O
, O
or O
it O
may O
never O
induce O
complete O
remission O
and O
you O
may O
need O
to O
try O
something O
else O
or O
add O
in O
something O
like O
MTX B-DRUG
. O

You O
may O
also O
respond O
well O
to O
the O
loading O
doses O
, O
but O
the O
efficacy O
reduces O
after O
you O
go O
onto O
the O
maintenance O
dose O
. O

We O
really O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
it O
's O
going O
to O
go O
for O
you O
, O
no O
- O
one O
does O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
affects O
each O
of O
us O
differently O
. O


If O
you O
are O
currently O
in O
a O
flare B-ADR
( O
frequent B-ADR
BMs I-ADR
, O
bleeding B-ADR
, O
pain B-ADR
, O
urgency O
etc O
) O
  O
and O
the O
mesalamine B-DRUG
/ O
mesalazine B-DRUG
is O
n't O
improving O
your O
symptoms B-ADR
you O
need O
to O
go O
see O
your O
GI O
ASAP O
. O



 O
Now O
to O
your O
question O
, O
but O
let O
me O
expand O
on O
it O
first O
. O

If O
you O
are O
flaring B-ADR
the O
# O
1 O
goal O
is O
to O
address O
the O
severe O
symptoms B-ADR
( O
bleeding B-ADR
, O
dehydration B-ADR
, O
anemia B-ADR
, O
malnourishment O
) O
. O

To O
achieve O
this O
typically O
you O
will O
be O
put O
on O
steroids B-DRUG
( O
prednisone B-DRUG
or O
some O
similar O
corticosteroid B-DRUG
) O
. O

In O
mild O
cases O
sometimes O
just O
mesalamine B-DRUG
orally O
and O
maybe O
localized O
steroid B-DRUG
enemas O
. O

These O
are O
fast O
acting O
and O
typically O
short O
term O
. O

Once O
in O
remission B-ADR
, O
or O
on O
the O
road O
to O
remission B-ADR
you O
should O
be O
put O
on O
a O
maintenance O
drug O
. O

These O
drugs O
maintain O
remission B-ADR
. O

This O
would O
be O
your O
Octasa B-DRUG
. O

If O
these O
low O
level O
drugs O
do O
n't O
keep O
you O
in O
remission B-ADR
, O
and O
you O
keep O
cycling O
on O
/ O
off O
the O
steroids B-DRUG
, O
then O
the O
next O
step O
is O
likely O
a O
biologic O
( O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Entyvio B-DRUG
, O
Remicade B-DRUG
, O
Stelara B-DRUG
, O
etc O
. O

) O
. O

Some O
doctors O
will O
try O
some O
medications O
in O
between O
, O
like O
light O
immunosuppressants O
, O
or O
increasing O
doses O
of O
mesalamine B-DRUG
. O

The O
biologics O
are O
typically O
infusions O
or O
injections O
. O

They O
are O
all O
a O
bit O
similar O
in O
that O
they O
are O
pretty O
strong O
, O
although O
they O
do O
work O
in O
different O
ways O
- O
so O
you O
may O
respond O
to O
some O
and O
not O
others O
. O

You O
essentially O
will O
be O
put O
on O
one O
, O
if O
it O
works O
, O
great O
you O
'll O
be O
on O
that O
as O
long O
as O
they O
can O
keep O
you O
on O
it O
. O

If O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
, O
or O
it O
stops B-ADR
working I-ADR
( O
usually O
due O
to O
developing B-ADR
antibodies I-ADR
) O
, O
you O
'll O
try O
another O
. O

Once O
you O
've O
been O
through O
the O
gambit O
the O
only\ O
* O
remaining O
option O
is O
surgery O
- O
which O
there O
are O
a O
few O
options O
here O
, O
colostomy O
, O
j O
- O
pouch O
, O
etc O
, O
but O
the O
idea O
is O
total O
removal O
of O
the O
colon O
at O
that O
point O
, O
which O
effectively O
' O
cures O
' O
you O
of O
the O
disease O
, O
although O
most O
of O
the O
surgical O
options O
come O
with O
their O
own O
issues O
and O
other O
health O
concerns O
. O



 O
\*They O
are O
constantly O
developing O
new O
biologics O
and O
there O
are O
other O
studies O
into O
other O
types O
of O
medication O
and O
treatments O
( O
like O
FMT O
) O
, O
so O
it O
's O
possible O
there O
are O
or O
will O
be O
alternatives O
to O
surgery O
, O
this O
is O
just O
the O
typical O
scenario O
. O


I O
personally O
did O
n’t O
have O
a O
positive O
experience O
, O
but O
my O
sister O
did O
! O

It O
allowed O
her O
to O
go O
back O
to O
school O
and O
get O
her O
master O
’s O
degree O
! O

She O
is O
currently O
working O
at O
the O
Boston O
chamber O
of O
commerce O
, O
and O
I O
could O
n’t O
be O
more O
proud O
of O
her O
. O

For O
me O
, O
I O
am O
just O
resistant O
to O
immunosuppressants O
, O
so O
we O
are O
still O
searching O
for O
one O
that O
works O
on O
me O
. O

I O
wish O
you O
the O
best O
of O
luck O
on O
humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
hope O
it O
helps O
! O


I O
've O
been O
medicated O
primarily O
for O
my O
joint B-ADR
stiffness I-ADR
rather O
than O
the O
fatigue B-ADR
. O

  O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
working O
wonders O
for O
my O
joints O
, O
and O
my O
fatigue B-ADR
is O
much O
better O
than O
it O
had O
once O
been O
. O

 

 O
I O
hope O
you O
find O
something O
that O
works O
for O
you O

about O
2 O
weeks O
away O

11 O
years O
and O
counting O
for O
humira B-DRUG

Humira B-DRUG
turned O
my O
life O
around O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
it O
for O
~7 O
years O
. O

Before O
I O
was O
on O
it O
, O
I O
could O
barely O
get O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

I O
feared O
the O
faintest O
crack O
in O
the O
sidewalk O
, O
because O
even O
the O
littlest O
hiccup O
in O
my O
step O
could O
send O
a O
debilitating O
wave O
of O
pain B-ADR
up O
my O
spine O
. O



 O
On O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
it O
's O
like O
I O
was O
taken O
back B-ADR
in O
time O
. O

My O
left O
hip O
still O
has O
cysts B-ADR
and O
burrs B-ADR
, O
my O
lower O
lumbar O
is O
still O
fused O
, O
but O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
pain B-ADR
. O

It O
's O
amazing O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
what O
remission O
is O
, O
I O
've O
never O
been O
told O
I O
'm O
in O
it O
, O
but O
this O
feels O
like O
it O
. O



 O
I O
do O
stress O
about O
long O
term O
consequences O
. O

I O
hate O
needing O
a O
medication O
to O
live O
. O

But O
Humira B-DRUG
lets O
me O
live O
. O


Wow O
the O
dark O
side O
of O
healthcare O
. O

The O
rash B-ADR
/ O
eczema B-ADR
started O
after O
enbrel B-DRUG
. O

When O
I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
but O
bites O
just O
lingered O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Rheumatologist O
finally O
decided O
to O
document O
me O
as O
“ O
allergic B-ADR
” O
to O
enbrel B-DRUG
and O
put O
me O
on O
a O
month O
of O
prednisone B-DRUG
to O
reset O
, O
and O
possible O
to O
back O
to O
humira B-DRUG
or O
try O
symphony O

Thank O
you O
! O

What O
are O
your O
hesitancies O
with O
starting O
Humira B-DRUG
? O


I O
’ve O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
almost O
1 O
year O
! O

! O


It O
was O
n’t O
until O
I O
got O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
saw O
significant O
improvement O
that O
I O
realized O
I O
was O
n’t O
living O
at O
a O
constant O
3 O
- O
4 O
, O
I O
was O
living O
at O
a O
constant O
6 O
with O
pops O
of O
7 O
- O
8 O
. O

What O
I O
’ve O
learned O
is O
those O
of O
us O
with O
autoimmune O
issues O
, O
particularly O
ones O
that O
are O
chronic B-ADR
pain I-ADR
oriented O
, O
learn O
to O
block O
out O
and O
live O
with O
the O
pain B-ADR
. O

It O
’s O
why O
professional O
football O
players O
can O
take O
hits O
5 O
times O
in O
a O
game O
that O
a O
normal O
person O
would O
be O
gasping B-ADR
for I-ADR
breath I-ADR
and O
crying B-ADR
over O
, O
they O
learn O
to O
take O
the O
hit O
and O
how O
to O
shake O
it O
off O
. O

It O
is O
n’t O
any O
less O
real O
or O
valid O
, O
you O
’re O
just O
used O
to O
it O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
’re O
able O
to O
get O
treatment O
so O
you O
can O
see O
just O
how O
much O
better O
life O
can O
be O
. O


I O
have O
had O
remicade B-DRUG
, O
humira B-DRUG
, O
stelara B-DRUG
and O
now O
I O
’m O
on O
entyvio B-DRUG
. O

I O
love O
entyvio B-DRUG
. O

I O
hope O
it O
helps O
you O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
it O
four O
years O
, O
every O
four O
weeks O
. O


I O
use O
All O
Free O
and O
Clear O
! O

It O
’s O
worked O
for O
under O
my O
arms O
quite O
well O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
get O
as O
much O
flares B-ADR
but O
I O
have O
tunneling O
still O
, O
horrible O
scars B-ADR
. O


The O
absolute O
worst O
was O
at O
my O
grandmas O
, O
she O
used O
the O
cheapest O
detergent O
she O
could O
find O
. O

It O
was O
awful O
. O



 O
I O
’ve O
never O
found O
the O
one O
thing O
that O
’s O
put O
me O
in O
remission O
but O
I O
’m O
hoping O
soon O
! O



 O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
helped O
, O
but O
if O
you O
see O
my O
post O
history O
, O
it O
’s O
more O
like O
massive B-ADR
spots I-ADR
all O
at O
once O
. O

Like O
I O
never O
put O
up O
my O
little O
pops O
. O

Lol O
. O

They O
’re O
always O
pretty O
big O
ones O
. O


I O
’m O
a O
little O
older O
at O
27 O
, O
was O
diagnosed O
about O
4 O
months O
ago O
after O
having O
issues O
for O
the O
past O
5 O
years O
. O

I O
’m O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
nothing O
has O
been O
working O
for O
you O
. O

I O
just O
got O
off O
Humira B-DRUG
as O
it O
has O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
, O
and O
I O
will O
be O
switching O
to O
Enbrel B-DRUG
this O
week O
. O

I O
also O
take O
Diclofenac B-DRUG
twice O
a O
day O
to O
to O
take O
the O
edge O
off O
of O
the O
pain B-ADR
a O
little O
bit O
