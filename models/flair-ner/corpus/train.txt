Yeah O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
that O
too O
. O

I O
'm O
on O
Aripiprazole B-DRUG
10 O
mg O
and O
it O
has O
also O
dampened O
my O
emotions O
but O
I O
am O
still O
able O
to O
feel O
depression B-ADR
almost O
as O
bad O
as O
it O
was O
before O
medication O
. O

I O
just O
started O
taking O
Fluoxetine B-DRUG
( O
Prozac B-DRUG
) O
20 O
mg O
so O
I O
'm O
hoping O
that O
'll O
lift O
me O
up O
a O
bit O
more O
. O



 O
Maybe O
you O
should O
speak O
with O
your O
psychiatrist O
about O
that O
, O
though O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
you O
'd O
have O
to O
increase O
the O
Abilify B-DRUG
or O
lower O
it O
. O

Hopefully O
you O
'll O
feel O
better O
soon O
:) O

So O
there O
are O
two O
things O
going O
on O
here O
. O

One O
, O
the O
vet O
is O
legally O
required O
to O
see O
their O
patents O
every O
year O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
give O
medical O
advice O
and O
to O
prescribe O
medications O
. O

So O
you O
have O
to O
at O
least O
get O
seen O
by O
a O
normal O
exam O
for O
the O
vet O
to O
LEGALLY O
be O
allowed O
to O
continue O
the O
prescription O
. O



 O
Two O
, O
fluoxetine B-DRUG
is O
metabolized O
through O
the O
liver O
, O
so O
many O
vets O
will O
do O
yearly O
bloodwork O
when O
an O
animal O
is O
on O
ANY O
prescription O
to O
make O
sure O
there O
is O
nothing O
else O
going O
on O
or O
changing O
that O
would O
require O
the O
vet O
to O
either O
change O
the O
dose O
, O
or O
discontinue O
the O
medication O
. O



 O
In O
short O
, O
you O
need O
to O
see O
a O
vet O
every O
year O
for O
at O
least O
an O
exam O
legally O
to O
get O
meds O
, O
and O
because O
this O
medication O
can O
screw O
with O
the O
liver O
, O
its O
best O
to O
get O
yearly O
bloodwork O
done O
to O
confirm O
nothing O
is O
changing O
. O


Oh O
your O
very O
welcome O
! O

I O
remember O
it O
was O
a O
way O
I O
could O
still O
peep O
sneakers O
I O
was O
so O
swollen B-ADR
and O
on O
Lasix B-DRUG
IV O
for O
over O
a O
month O
. O

Since O
transplant O
back O
to O
my O
AJ1 O
obsession O
& O
got O
a O
pair O
of O
new O
balances O
for O
pure O
comfort O
! O


Yes O
, O
expect O
a O
flare B-ADR
after O
you O
stop O
taking O
Prednisone B-DRUG
, O
pills O
or O
cream O
. O



 O
Twice O
in O
the O
past O
five O
months O
, O
I O
was O
offered O
that O
demon O
drug O
prednisone B-DRUG
. O

Oral O
prednisone B-DRUG
should O
be O
limited O
to O
systemic O
poison O
ivy O
. O

  O
25 O
years O
ago O
I O
was O
on O
Prednisone B-DRUG
for O
six O
months O
. O



 O
Prednisone B-DRUG
pills O
are O
a O
miracle O
drug O
for O
ONE O
day O
. O

Then O
your O
body O
stops O
making O
cortisol O
. O

When O
you O
stop O
taking O
Prednisone B-DRUG
your O
body O
has O
to O
start O
making O
cortisol O
. O

This O
rebound O
may O
take O
one O
week O
to O
eight O
weeks O
. O

I O
have O
a O
friend O
that O
has O
lost O
ability O
to O
make O
cortisol O
forever O
. O


Lipitor B-DRUG
, O
it O
helps O
me O
prevent O
any O
more O
strokes B-ADR

Can O
confirm O
. O

I O
love O
lavender O
( O
not O
for O
magic O
reasons O
, O
I O
like O
the O
way O
it O
smells O
) O
and O
I O
buy O
the O
cheap O
stuff O
at O
Walmart O
/ O
target O
/ O
the O
dollar O
store O
. O

I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
realize O
the O
last O
one O
was O
more O
concentrated O
( O
I O
guess O
a O
better O
value O
since O
I O
paid O
like O
$ O
5 O
for O
it O
) O
and O
added O
it O
to O
my O
. O

Lotion O
- O
ended O
up O
at O
urgent O
care O
with O
dry B-ADR
patches I-ADR
and O
hives B-ADR
, O
watery B-ADR
eyes I-ADR
, O
a O
dandruff B-ADR
- I-ADR
like I-ADR
rash I-ADR
on O
my O
scalp O
and O
my O
skin B-ADR
itched I-ADR
and O
burned B-ADR
like O
crazy O
, O
even O
where O
it O
was O
n‚Äôt O
red B-ADR
and O
irritated B-ADR
. O

Yay O
I O
got O
put O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
and O
this O
antihistamine O
that O
‚Äôs O
stronger O
than O
Benadryl B-DRUG
for O
a O
few O
days O
‚Ä¶ O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
even O
have O
allergies B-ADR
, O
just O
mild O
rosacea B-ADR
! O

And O
I O
would O
never O
come O
close O
to O
my O
face O
with O
any O
essential O
oil O
. O

Just O
added O
sevetal O
drops O
to O
unscented O
Aveeno O
lotion O
. O


Casual O
Opiate O
use O
is O
really O
fantastic O
. O

I O
've O
never O
developed O
a O
habit O
, O
and O
I O
have O
a O
persistent O
shoulder O
injury B-ADR
that O
pops O
up O
once O
a O
year O
or O
so O
that O
I O
previously O
was O
able O
to O
fix O
using O
a O
weeks O
worth O
of O
muscle O
relaxers+prednisone+opiates B-DRUG
so O
I O
could O
actually O
get O
some O
restful O
sleep O
and O
repair O
. O



 O
Unfortunately O
I O
ca O
n't O
even O
get O
three O
days O
worth O
anymore O
, O
even O
after O
years O
of O
it O
working O
consistently O
and O
fixing O
the O
problem O
. O

I O
've O
let O
them O
poke O
me O
with O
needles O
in O
my O
joint O
, O
the O
whole O
nine O
yards(which O
was O
the O
most O
painful B-ADR
thing O
i O
ve O
ever O
experienced O
) O
. O

Three O
days O
of O
opiates O
? O

out O
of O
the O
question O

Hi O
there O
, O
I O
know O
this O
thread O
is O
VERY O
old O
but O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
follow O
up O
‚Ä¶ O
I O
asked O
my O
GYN O
about O
this O
and O
she O
told O
me O
it O
does O
n‚Äôt O
actually O
work O
like O
that O
. O

Turns O
out O
, O
I O
had O
ALSO O
just O
started O
Prozac B-DRUG
which O
just O
‚Ä¶ O
skyrocketed O
me O
into O
this O
months O
- O
long O
hypomanic O
phase O
that O
only O
stopped O
after O
I O
switched O
meds O
üò≥ O
just O
a O
heads O
up O
in O
case O
anyone O
else O
is O
experiencing O
the O
same O
thing O
! O

( O
It O
‚Äôs O
nice O
to O
have O
my O
mental O
health O
back O
in O
check O
a O
bit O
but O
mannn O
do O
I O
miss O
that O
libido O
üòÖ O
) O

Had O
4 O
rounds O
of O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
( O
two O
years O
) O
and O
never O
got O
sick B-ADR

I O
was O
last O
year O
when O
I O
started O
taking O
the O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
, O
but O
I O
‚Äôve O
dropped O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O

  O
I O
‚Äôm O
5‚Äô11 O
‚Äù O
, O
was O
about O
210 O
pounds O
March O
2021 O
. O

  O
About O
170 O
today O
. O


Thought O
type O
1 O
was O
too O
much O
insulin O
and O
they O
needed O
sugar O
to O
maintain O
the O
over O
abundance O
of O
insulin O
their O
body O
produced O
. O

My O
gf O
is O
on O
insulin O
and O
she O
‚Äôs O
type O
2 O
, O
she O
started O
out O
on O
metformin B-DRUG
but O
it O
was O
n‚Äôt O
enough O
to O
get O
it O
under O
control O
, O
so O
her O
doctor O
has O
her O
on O
insulin O
to O
keep O
her O
sugar O
in O
the O
100 O
range O
. O

Also O
, O
exercise O
definitely O
helps O
maintain O
sugar O
without O
medication O
so O
I O
see O
where O
he O
‚Äôs O
coming O
from O
, O
but O
when O
you O
‚Äôre O
so O
used O
to O
certain O
lifestyles O
, O
it O
‚Äôs O
very O
hard O
to O
mentally O
break O
the O
unhealthy O
habits O
that O
lead O
to O
the O
diagnosis O
originally O
. O


Yeah O
that O
‚Äôs O
perfect O
no O
I O
I O
was O
told O
that O
other O
antidepressants O
like O
Prozac B-DRUG
and O
stuff O
already O
are O
good O
to O
get O
off O
because O
they O
have O
a O
longer O
half O
- O
life O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
and O
they O
have O
less O
side O
effects O
but O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
really O
want O
to O
go O
on O
another O
antidepressant O
honestly O
that O
I O
just O
want O
to O
get O
off O
this O
and O
try O
and O
heal O
for O
a O
bit O
but O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
at O
the O
lowest O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
I O
took O
it O
every O
other O
day O
when O
I O
took O
every O
second O
day O
and O
then O
I O
stopped O
and O
then O
I O
found O
out O
that O
you O
can O
take O
the O
little O
three O
pedo O
so O
I O
took O
to O
be O
do O
n‚Äôt O
instead O
of O
three O
instead O
of O
having O
three O
and O
then O
I O
did O
that O
for O
like O
a O
week O
and O
then O
now O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
taken O
out O
one O
bed O
for O
like O
the O
past O
three O
days O

We O

with O
metropolol B-DRUG

I O
want O

As O
soon O
as O
the O

'll O
try O
that O

The O
DNA O
for O
the O

fixed O

the O
embryo O

As O
a O
learning O

always O
scan O

draw O
up O

administer O
meds O
that O
come O
in O
a O
vial O
one O
at O
a O
time O

I O
found O
so O
often O
I O
was O
giving O
protonix B-DRUG

other O
random O
stuff O
all O
at O

That O
way O
you O
can O
double O
check O
the O
orders O
as O
you O
go O

you O
'll O
be O
more O

whether O

I O

I O
also O
did O

Yes O

I O
've O
struggled O
with O
Depression B-ADR

Anxiety B-ADR
my O
whole O
life O
, O
because O
I O
have O
ADHD O
and O
a O
Trauma O
from O
abuse O
. O

When O
I O
got O
pregnant O
, O
my O
mental O
health O
improved O
so O
much O
! O

Aside O
from O
struggling O
with O
feeling O
lonely O
and O
isolated O
( O
which O
I O
* O
am O
* O
, O
so O
there O
's O
that O
) O
I O
felt O
genuinely O
and O
truly O
happy O
. O

Calm O
, O
at O
peace O
, O
just O
* O
happy O
* O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
feel O
this O
way O
! O



 O
Now O
I O
have O
4 O
weeks O
left O
until O
my O
due O
date O
and O
I O
think O
my O
hormones O
started O
shifting O
again O
. O

I O
have O
more O
pregnancy O
symptoms O
now O
, O
my O
cat O
is O
acting O
weird O
around O
me O
and O
my O
depression B-ADR
slowly O
comes O
creeping O
back O
. O

I O
talked O
to O
my O
OB O
about O
it O
and O
he O
immediately O
sent O
me O
to O
a O
psychatrist O
with O
an O
urgent O
notice O
to O
get O
me O
on O
Zoloft B-DRUG
* O
* O
now O
* O
* O
, O
so O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
side O
depression B-ADR
, O
effects O
and O
a O

Why O
do O
n‚Äôt O
they O
do O
the O
double O
dose O
as O
standard O
treatment O
? O

To O
many O
side O
effects O
? O



 O
Quite O
simply O
, O
because O
this O
trial O
has O
n‚Äôt O
yet O
been O
completed O
so O
we O
do O
n‚Äôt O
yet O
have O
evidence O
of O
whether O
this O
treatment O
method O
is O
superior O
. O



 O
Rituxan B-DRUG
is O
dosed O
based O
on O
weight O
, O
but O
when O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
went O
through O
the O
trials O
, O
they O
chose O
the O
600 O
mg O
dose O
as O
the O
one O
most O
likely O
to O
fulfill O
the O
trial O
endpoints O
. O



 O
Any O
medication O
approved O
for O
use O
has O
to O
weigh O
the O
risks O
( O
in O
this O
case O
, O
a O
risk O
of O
too O
much O
suppression O
of O
the O
immune O
system O
, O
possibly O
leading O
to O
lymphopenia B-ADR
) O
against O
the O
rewards O
( O
potentially O
better O
overall O
suppression O
of O
MS O
activity O
) O
and O
then O
a O
decision O
is O
made O
whether O
or O
not O
there O
is O
enough O
added O
benefit O
to O
justify O
the O
added O
risk O
. O

  O
Typically O
the O
dosage O
chosen O
is O
the O
lowest O
dose O
that O
gave O
favourable O
results O
. O



 O

	 O
Also O
having O
in O
mind O
that O
a O
higher O
dose O
penetrates O
deeper O
, O
could O
we O
say O
that O
the O
standard O
dose O
of O
ocrevus B-DRUG
is O
better O
than O
kesimpta B-DRUG
at O
doing O
this O
? O



 O
This O
possibility O
of O
a O
higher O
dose O
penetrating O
deeper O
is O
still O
in O
the O
‚Äò O

Hi O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
aware O
of O
what O
insulin O
is O
and O
I O
understand O
  O
how O
it O
works O
. O

All O
I O
did O
for O
the O
first O
6 O
months O
that O
he O
was O
diagnosed O
was O
research O
. O

Metformin B-DRUG
is O
enough O
for O
him O
right O
now O
because O
it O
was O
diagnosed O
so O
early O
. O

I O
also O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
type O
1 O
and O
type O
2 O
and O
what O
metformin B-DRUG
does O
. O

His O
case O
is O
n't O
typical O
, O
like O
I O
said O
. O

there O
are O
many O
different O
things O
that O
can O
happen O
with O
diabetes O
that O
are O
cruelly O
under O
researched O
. O

metformin B-DRUG
may O
not O
have O
worked O
for O
you O
, O
but O
it O
does O
right O
now O
for O
him O
. O

it O
probably O
wo O
n't O
for O
much O
longer O
, O
but O
it O
does O
now O
. O

he O
's O
been O
able O
to O
lose O
over O
50 O
lbs O
and O
lower O
his O
a1c O
from O
9.8 O
to O
like O
5.3 O
. O

But O
he O
is O
type O
1 O
because O
he O
has O
the O
antibodies O
that O
attack O
the O
insulin O
. O


Are O
you O
on O
metformin B-DRUG
, O

? O

That O
might O
be O
why O
... O

This O
giant O
coffee O
mug O
from O
the O
80s O
( O
maybe O
early O
90s O
) O
that O
's O
an O
advertisement O
for O
Zoloft B-DRUG

It O
has O
a O
big O
picture O

an O
elderly O

wildly O

" O
It O
's O
pretty O
much O
my O
most O
prized O
possession O
. O

( O
I O
've O
taken O
Zoloft B-DRUG
for O
15 O
years O
) O

Pt O
said O
he O
was O
here O
to O

pick O
up O
his O
formaldehyde B-DRUG
" O
( O
furosemide B-DRUG

üôÉ O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
osteopenia B-ADR
around O
19 O
. O

Actually O
my O
boss O
was O
the O
one O
who O
told O
me O
to O
go O
get O
tested O
because O
I O
kept O
breaking O
bones O
and O
she O
was O
right O
. O



 O
I O
would O
n't O
completely O
rule O
out O
hormone O
therapy O
. O

There O
maybe O
a O
doctors O
willing O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Yes O
ideally O
you O
want O
to O
avoid O
medications O
that O
can O
lower B-ADR
bone I-ADR
density I-ADR
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
sometimes O
there O
's O
other O
medical O
issues O
that O
are O
more O
important O
. O

Like O
I O
'm O
on O
long O
term O
prednisone B-DRUG
despite O
that O
, O
because O
without O
it O
my O
life O
would O
be O
in O
danger O
. O

You O
may O
very O
well O
find O
a O
doctor O
still O
willing O
to O
work O
with O
you O
and O
perscribe O
you O
hormone O
therapy O
because O
they O
realize O
the O
importance O
of O
your O
mental O
health O
that O
comes O
from O
being O
able O
to O
live O
as O
your O
true O
self O
. O

And O
there O
are O
medications O
they O
can O
perscribe O
to O
treat O
osteoporosis B-ADR
. O


Why O
... O
why O
do O
I O
remember O
this O
shit O
and O
not O
certain O
moments O
of O
my O
life O
I O
'd O
rather O
? O



 O
They O
tell O
me O
repeated O
TBI O
... O
wonder O
where O
that O
TBI O
is O
when O
I O
have O
night B-ADR
terrors I-ADR
cause O
of O
the O
past O
or O
cross O
the O
street O
with O
the O
wife O
when O
some O
trash O
at O
the O
curb O
looks O
wonky O
, O
or O
when O
I O
could O
n't O
do O
shit O
for O
my O
Ma O
when O
she O
called O
me O
the O
last O
time O
ever O
. O



 O
Those O
are O
a O
few O
that O
shit O
could O
fuck O
86 O
with O
a O
quickness O
. O



 O
Not O
trying O
to O
sound O
mopey O
, O
but O
rather O
angry O
at O
my O
... O
biology O
? O

Why O
is O
it O
I O
have O
to O
think O
long O
and O
hard O
to O
remember O
her O
and O
my O
last O
fishing O
trip O
, O
but O
that O
fucking O
last O
call O
is O
qued O
up O
at O
the O
drop O
of O
a O
hat O
? O



 O
Do O
n't O
know O
if O
that O
make O
sense O
. O

But O
it O
is O
what O
it O
is O
. O

Perhaps O
I O
've O
been O
feeding O
the O
wrong O
wolf O
for O
too O
long O
. O

Here O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
feed O
the O
good O
one O
into O
Lipitor B-DRUG
since O
I O
got O
out O
. O

Maybe O
the O
fucker O
had O
a O
heart B-ADR
attack I-ADR
. O

I O
dunno O
. O

Just O
FUBAR O
today O
I O
guess O
. O


And O
ask O
him O
if O
you O
can O
come O
off O
glipizide B-DRUG
and O
just O
stay O
on O
metformin B-DRUG
. O

  O
Glipizide B-DRUG
is O
most O
likely O
the O
culprit O
. O


Is O
there O
any O
way O
you O
think O
I O
could O
consume O
weed O
that O
would O
benefit O
anxiety B-ADR
best O
? O

I O
‚Äôve O
tried O
ssris O

propanolol B-DRUG

was O
on O
a O

they O
arnt O
good O
for O

I O
came O

I O
really O

though O
, O
I O
appreciate O
your O
perspective O
. O

  O
Thank O
you O
for O
being O
here O
! O

  O
And O
I O
understand O
the O
way O
you O
're O
wording O
the O
diagnosis O
part O
. O

  O
That O
's O
a O
great O
way O
to O
say O
it O
. O



 O
Yeah O
, O
I O
really O
heavily O
relate O
to O
the O
way O
Adrien O
's O
C B-ADR
- I-ADR
PTSD I-ADR
is O
expressed O
. O

  O
I O
also O
feel O
like O
because O
he O
has O
that O
people O
- O
pleasing O
fawn O
response O
, O
people O
see O
his O
trauma O
as O
less O
severe O
or O
valid O
because O
he O
seems O
happy O
and O
cooperative O
( O
happens O
to O
me O
all O
the O
time O
. O

) O
  O
And O
yes O
, O
definitely O
the O
depression B-ADR
for O
him O
too O
. O



 O
Also O
I O
definitely O
agree O
with O
you O
on O
Marinette O
having O
classic O
PTSD B-ADR
and O
generalized O
anxiety B-ADR
disorder I-ADR
. O

  O
Hypervigilance O
is O
the O
right O
word O
. O

  O
Never O
thought O
about O
her O
having O
ADHD O
but O
it O
definitely O
makes O
sense O
with O
how O
you O
explain O
it O
. O



 O
Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
the O
well O
wishes O
! O

  O
It O
's O
been O
difficult O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
doing O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
, O
getting O
therapy O
, O
making O
lifestyle O
changes O
, O
and O
working O
to O
build O
a O
support O
system O
. O

  O
Was O
on O
Prozac B-DRUG
for O
a O
while O
but O
I O
'm O
weaning O
off O
of O
it O
now O
. O

  O
I O
've O
also O
found O
caring O
for O
pets O
and O
plants O
very O
therapeutic O
. O

:) O

I O
got O
my O
recipe O
for O
the O
diabetologist O
from O
my O
OB O
/ O
Gyn O
. O

Maybe O
ask O
them O
? O

Your O
GP O
should O
also O
give O
you O
one O
when O
you O
ask O
for O
one O
. O

There O
is O
a O
comorbidity O
with O
pcos O
and O
diabetes O
type O
2 O
so O
it O
is O
not O
an O
unnecessary O
procedure O
you O
demand O
. O

Maybe O
you O
have O
to O
demand O
a O
recipe O
for O
a O
diabetologist O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
stress O
. O

Do O
n't O
let O
them O
tell O
you O
that O
this O
is O
not O
necessary O
. O

It O
is O
! O


Maybe O
look O
into O
insulin B-ADR
resistance I-ADR
and O
ask O
yourself O
if O
this O
is O
a O
problem O
for O
you O
. O

Especially O
the O
fatigue B-ADR
and O
low O
energy O
may O
be O
a O
symptom O
( O
but O
also O
applies O
to O
other O
hormonal O
disease O
like O
thyroid B-ADR
problems I-ADR
) O
. O


Though O
your O
lifestyle O
( O
diet O
, O
supplements O
, O
activity O
) O
suggest O
that O
you O
already O
live O
a O
very O
diabetic O
- O
friendly O
life O
. O



 O
I O
also O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
go O
to O
an O
endocrinologist O
but O
they O
are O
rare O
and O
there O
are O
not O
enough O
in O
Germany O
, O
so O
I O
am O
sorry O
you O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
too O
. O

A O
diabetologist O
is O
the O
second O
best O
option O
here O
especially O
if O
your O
Ob O
/ O
Gyn O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
treat O
pcos O
besides O
giving O
you O
BC O
. O

I O
am O
very O
lucky O
that O
mine O
knows O
that O
she O
does O
not O
know O
everything O
and O
is O
not O
too O
proud O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
opinion O
of O
another O
specialist O
. O

So O
if O
you O
have O
the O
feeling O
that O
your O
Ob O
/ O
Gyn O
is O
not O
open O
for O
a O
second O
opinion O
consider O
going O
to O
another O
ob O
/ O
Gyn O
that O
is O
open O
for O
medication O
like O
Spironolactone B-DRUG
and/or O
Metformin B-DRUG
. O

If O
they O
do O
not O
give O
you O
a O
recipe O
themself O
( O
what O
is O
fine O
if O
they O
do O
not O
know O
the O
stuff O
) O
they O
should O
at O
least O
give O
advice O
how O
to O
get O
a O
doctor O
who O
may O
be O
able O
to O
. O



 O
I O
hope O
you O
find O
the O
help O
you O
need O
! O

And O
I O
am O
really O
sorry O
that O
our O
health O
system O
does O
not O
offer O
a O
modern O
and O
easy O
treatment O
. O

I O
am O
a O
health O
economist O
so O
these O
things O
like O
dealing O
with O
doctors O
come O
more O
easy O
to O
me O
but O
I O
can O
imagine O
that O
it O
's O
very O
hard O
to O
find O
guidance O
in O
our O
system O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
maybe O
( O
? O

) O
not O
a O
native O
speaker O
as O
it O
is O
already O
complicated O
. O


Some O
drugs O
you O
can O
& O
should O
push O
fast O
( O
adenosine B-DRUG
springs O
to O
mind O
) O
but O
things O
like O
steroids O
need O
a O
slower O
push O
‚Äî O
solumedrol O
makes O
people O
‚Äôs O
legs O
feel O
like O
they O
‚Äôre O
on O
fire O
or O
being O
stabbed O
with O
needles O
if O
you O
push O
it O
too O
fast O
. O

Dexamethasone B-DRUG
produces O
‚Äú O
perianal B-ADR
itching I-ADR
‚Äù O
which O
is O
apparently O
a O
nice O
way O
to O
say O
it O
feels O
like O
their O
ass O
is O
on O
fire O
( O
according O
to O
a O
pt O
who O
had O
it O
slammed O
in O
the O
ED O
) O
. O



 O
I O
try O
to O
push O
Dilaudid B-DRUG
slowly O
because O
if O
you O
slam O
it O
they O
can O
feel O
really O
dissociative O
, O
which O
some O
patients O
love O
and O
want O
, O
but O
some O
really O
hate O
and O
can O
cause O
some O
anxiety B-ADR
. O



 O
It O
‚Äôs O
so O
tedious O
to O
slow O
push O
and O
I O
‚Äôve O
had O
precepting O
nurses O
roll O
their O
eyes O
at O
me O
, O
but O
I O
‚Äôm O
too O
new O
a O
nurse O
and O
I O
want O
to O
treat O
my O
patients O
like O
I O
would O
want O
for O
my O
family O
. O



 O
It O
does O
n‚Äôt O
have O
to O
be O
5 O
minutes O
, O
you O
can O
do O
your O
first O
5 O
ml O
of O
flush O
fast O
, O
and O
depending O
on O
your O
tubing O
/ O
catheter O
setup O
, O
even O
slam O
that O
1 O
ml O
or O
so O
because O
it O
wo O
n‚Äôt O
reach O
the O
patient O
‚Ä¶ O
but O
then O
you O
want O
the O
following O
flush O
to O
be O
a O
slower O
rate O
. O



 O
The O
best O
is O
when O
they O
‚Äôre O
already O
hooked O
up O
to O
a O
normal O
saline O
drip O
. O

Pause O
the O
pump O
, O
scrub O
the O
hub O
closest O
to O
the O
pt O
, O
kink O
the O
tube O
from O
the O
pump O
next O
to O
the O
hub O
, O
flush O
it O
with O
a O
couple O
mills O
to O
make O
sure O
there O
‚Äôs O
no O
leftover O
med O
from O
the O
last O
med O
push O
in O
there O
, O
push O
in O
your O
ml O
or O
so O
of O
med O
, O
flush O
a O
ml O
, O
let O
go O
of O
the O
line O
and O
restart O
the O
pump O
at O
a O
15 O
- O
20ml O
/ O
hr O
rate O
while O
you O
do O
other O
stuff O
in O
the O
room O
. O

The O
20 O
ml O
/ O
hr O
equals O
1ml O
over O
3 O
minutes O
, O
so O
go O
15ml O
/ O
hr O
for O
solumedrol O
or O
more O
than O
1ml O
of O
Lasix B-DRUG
. O



 O
I O
had O
a O
couple O
preceptors O
tell O
me O
to O
just O
push O
- O
pause O
for O
the O
long O
/ O
slow O
ones O
and O
to O
do O
other O
stuff O
in O
the O
room O
in O
between O
, O
but O
you O
‚Äôll O
have O
to O
disconnect O
the O
flush O
and O
scrub O
between O
each O
push O
because O
if O
you O
leave O
the O
flush O
attached O
, O
the O
pt O
will O
flop O
their O
arms O
around O
and O
manage O
to O
dislodge O
their O
IV O
. O

At O
least O
in O
my O
experience O
. O


I O
‚Äôve O
tired O
so O
many O
natural O
methods O
and O
it O
was O
so O
hard O
to O
get O
through O
PMDD B-ADR
during O
that O
time O
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
also O
tried O
Zoloft B-DRUG
, O
Celexa B-DRUG
and O
Prozac B-DRUG
and O
WOW O
prozac B-DRUG
has O
been O
a O
game O
changer O
for O
me O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
, O
low B-ADR
estrogen I-ADR
and O
low B-ADR
progesterone I-ADR
. O

Took O
3 O
times O
to O
find O
the O
right O
BC O
. O

But O
I O
‚Äôd O
almost O
say O
it O
‚Äôs O
smooth O
sailing O
now O

Always O
thought O
it O
is O
propanolol B-DRUG
‚Ä¶ O
but O
it O
is O
propranolol B-DRUG

I O
take O
metformin B-DRUG
and O
poop O
a O
lot O
üò≠ O
üí© O

I O
had O
zero O
complications O
up O
until O
after O
labor O
, O
other O
than O
many O
months O
of O
preterm O
contractions O
that O
kept O
fooling O
my O
docs O
( O

me O
) O
into O
thinking O
it O
was O
real O
labor O
. O

Normal O
HR O
, O
BP O
. O

  O
I O
had O
shortness B-ADR
of I-ADR
breath I-ADR
laying O
down O
, O
but O
what O
mamma O
does O
n't O
when O
she O
's O
9 O
months O
pregnant O
? O

I O
was O
fatigued B-ADR
and O
my O
feet O
were O
swollen B-ADR
, O
but O
again O
, O
how O
could O
you O
tell O
the O
difference O
? O



 O
5 O
days O
after O
labor O
my O
lungs O
started O
filling O
with O
liquid O
and O
I O
could O
hear O
soda O
fizzing O
noises O
with O
each O
exhalation O
and O
my O
ankles O
/ O
feet O
were O
still O
very O
swollen B-ADR
. O

I O
got O
it O
checked O
out O
and O
my O
HR O
was O
40 O
, O
my O
BP O
was O
190/100 O
, O
and O
my O
heart B-ADR
was I-ADR
failing I-ADR
( O
echocardiogram O
confirmed O
) O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
bad O
failure O
and O
I O
'm O
just O
a O
handful O
of O
percentage O
points O
away O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O

( O
the O
official O
measurement O
used O
to O
diagnose O
heart B-ADR
failure I-ADR
) O
... O
and O
water O
pills O
have O
gotten O
rid O
of O
the O
water O
. O



 O
I O
tried O
hydralazine B-DRUG
and O
water O
pills O
( O
furosemide B-DRUG
) O
for O
5 O
weeks O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
enough O
to O
help O
get O
BP O
back B-ADR
down O
while O
the O
heart O
healed O
itself O
because O
those O
two O
meds O
are O
breastfeeding O
friendly O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
help O
. O

I O
've O
been O
taking O
carvedilol B-DRUG
( O
a O
beta O
blocker O
that O
reduces O
BP O
and O
HR O
and O
adrenaline O
generally O
) O
and O
Losartan O
to O
reduce O
BP O

help O
repair O
heart O
muscle O
fibers O
. O

  O
They O
are O
not O
BF O
friendly O
, O
so O
I O
stopped O
breastfeeding O
/ O
pumping O
at O
5 O
weeks O
. O

  

 O
7 O
months O
later O
there O
has O
been O
minimal O
improvement O
in O
my O
ejection O
fraction O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
feel O
as O
completely O
smashed O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
go O
up O
the O
stairs O
without O
a O
break O
and O
heart B-ADR
pounding I-ADR
before O
, O
and O
now O
I O
can O
climb O
the O
stairs O
at O

12 O

a O

without O

The O
two O

most O
effective O

both O
have O
the O
side O
effect O
of O

that O
's O
fun O
to O
add O
to O

fatigue B-ADR

normal O
baby O

 O
It O
can O
take O
up O

12 O

recover O
, O
and O
most O
cardiologists O
will O
want O
to O
keep O
you O
on O
the O
cardiac O
meds O
for O
at O

12 O

even O
if O
you O

there O
is O
about O
a O
20 O

doing O

at O

hope O
it O
is O
because O

Sertraline B-DRUG
made O
me O
more O
insulin O
resistant O

I O
was O
EXTREMELY O
angry O
at O
my O
prescribers O
when O
I O
found O
out O
, O
because O
they O
knew O
that O
I O
had O

issues O
with O

prescribed O
it O
to O
me O
anyways O
. O

I O
get O
that O
sertraline B-DRUG
works O
well O
for O
most O
people O

I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
even O
get O
the O
opportunity O

make O
an O
educated O
choice O
about O
the O

it O
would O
have O
in O
my O
PCOS O

 O
Once O
I O
brought O
this O
up O

told O
them O
I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
appreciate O
being O
on O
an O

that O
was O
making O
my O

worse O
I O
was O
gradually O
switched O
to O
Wellbutrin B-DRUG
which O
actually O
makes O
people O
more O

it O
‚Äôs O
considered O
to O
be O
good O
for O

it O
worked O

n‚Äôt O
make O

at O

you O
‚Äôre O
within O
your O

 O

absolutely O
nothing O

 O
Many O
people O
are O
prescribed O
both O
metformin B-DRUG

insulin O
because O
the O
metformin B-DRUG
helps O
, O
but O
is O
n't O
enough O
by O
itself O
. O

They O
still O
need O

Sorry O

hear O
this O
, O
at O

you O
managed O

your O

It O
can O

I O
take O
it O

going O

my O
doctor O
tomorrow O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
can O
think O

is O
the O
high O
dose O
of O
prednisone B-DRUG
that O
i O
was O
on O

up I-ADR
to O
avoid O
going O
back O
on O
it O

hydroxyzine B-DRUG
first O
before O
trying O

I O
am O
prescribed O
klonopin B-DRUG

i O

i O
have O
it O
if O
i O
absolutely O
need O
it O
. O

if O
neither O

those O

you O

I O
pimped O
him O

the O

he O
had O
no O

Unfortunately O
it O
's O

smthng O
uncommon O

If O
it O
does O
n't O
work O

no O

get O
the O

requesting O
compassionate O

so O
far O
they O
seemed O
very O
supportive O
, O
u O
might O
get O
em O
for O
free O
or O
at O
minimal O

Alternatively O
speak O

Stay O

I O
dealt O
with O
hypertension B-ADR
issues O
, O
too O
, O
and O
finally O
accepted O
my O
doctor O
‚Äôs O
recommendation O
to O
go O
on O
a O
very O
light O
dose O
of O
lisinopril B-DRUG
. O

I O
would O
strongly O
recommend O
you O
address O
this O
‚Äî O
even O
if O
it O
‚Äôs O
‚Äú O
not O
interfering O
‚Äù O
right O
now O
, O
it O
could O
be O
doing O
long O

damage O
. O


A O
lot O
of O
meds O
make O
me O
sleepy B-ADR
. O

So O
I O
take O
them O
at O
night O
and O
they O
help O
me O
sleep O
, O
although O
I O
also O
seem O
to O
recall O
reading O
that O
lisinopril B-DRUG
is O
less O
effective O
at O
night O
for O
some O
reason O
so O
if O
it O
does O
n't O
control O
your O
BP O
during O
the O
next O
day O
, O
you O
may O
need O
to O
start O
taking O
it O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
not O
at O
night O

 O

the O

time O
, O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
hard O
to O
figure O
out O
which O
med O
is O
causing O
which O
side O
effect O
. O



 O
But O
mostly O
if O
anything O
just O
sleepiness B-ADR
. O

And O
that O
side O
effect O
seems O
to O
go O
away O
( O
or O
your O
body O
adapts O
) O
pretty O
quickly O
- O
a O
few O
months O
. O


I O
'm O
9 O
months O
in O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
I O
just O
got O
two O
bad O
flares B-ADR
in O
my O
underarm O
and O
groin O
. O

I O
really O
wish O
Humira B-DRUG
would O
work O
for O
me O
. O


If O
you O
get O
racing B-ADR
heart I-ADR
and O
sweats B-ADR
try O
a O
fast O
acting O
beta O
blocker O
like O
propanolol B-DRUG
. O

Lowering O
your O
heart O
rate O
will O
reduce O
body O
anxiety B-ADR
. O


You O
‚Äôll O
find O
a O
lot O
of O
posts O
here O
saying O
the O
opposite O
, O
that O
Zoloft B-DRUG
actually O
reduced O
the O
desire O
to O
drink O
alcohol O

 O
I O
‚Äôd O
speak O
to O

if O
you O
‚Äôre O

I O
was O
actually O
on O
Prozac B-DRUG
10 O
mg O
before O
because O
I O
have O
GAD B-ADR
but O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
so O
much O
more O
than O
that O
. O

I O
just O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
vanish O
and O
nobody O
would O
care O
. O


Have O
you O
tried O
a O
beta O

like O
propanolol B-DRUG
? O

I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
understand O
what O
it O
is O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

I O
would O
get O
racing B-ADR
heart I-ADR
, O
sweats B-ADR
, O
and O
shakes B-ADR
but O
did O
n‚Äôt O
understand O
it O
was O
from O
anxiety B-ADR
. O

Propanolol B-DRUG
helped O
all O
these O
symptoms O
because O
it O
lowers O
your O
heart O
rate O
and O
is O
fast O
acting O
and O
there O
is O
no O
sedation B-ADR
. O


Someone O
broke O
into O
my O
car O
and O
stole O
my O
purse O
with O
all O
my O
meds O
. O

Would O
you O
like O
me O
to O
refill O
your O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
as O
well O
? O

! O

No O
, O
I O
still O
have O
that O
one O
üôÑ O

I O
‚Äôm O
pretty O
sure O
you O
can O
run O
a O
heparin B-DRUG
and O
lasix B-DRUG
drip O
together O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
a O
pretty O
easy O
mistake O
. O

Two O
clear O
liquids O
in O
syringes O
. O


Would O
you O
just O
start O
the O
the O
mk B-DRUG
and O
metformin B-DRUG
together O
? O

And O
just O
stop O
when O
you O
're O
done O
with O
mk B-DRUG
? O

Do O
you O
have O
to O
taper O
off O
met O
? O


This O
is O
extremely O
interesting O
. O

Would O
you O
mind O
sharing O
your O
dosing O
schedule O
, O
as O
I O
'm O
about O
to O
try O
and O
go O
off O
Zoloft B-DRUG
myself O
? O

Do O
you O
have O
any O
theory O
as O
to O
why O
a O
dopamine O
boosting O
supplement O
such O
as O
DLPA O
would O
counteract O
SSRI O
withdrawal B-ADR
symptoms O
? O


Yes O
that O
is O
what O
I O
am O
going O
through O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
trying O
Zoloft B-DRUG
for O
depression B-ADR
but O
I O
think O
it O
‚Äôs O
just O
giving O
me O
mixed O
episode O
symptoms O
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
tried O
Wellbutrin B-DRUG
with O
some O
success O
but O
never O
fully O
. O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
know O
what O
else O
to O
try O
for O
the O
depression B-ADR

I O
ended O
up O
stopping O
metformin B-DRUG
because O
it O
made O
me O
so O
sick B-ADR
. O

Even O
at O
lower O
doses O
. O

They O
said O
that O
fine O
since O
my O
A1c O
is O
lowering O
without O
it O
thankfully O

I O
get O
you O
:) O
And O
it O
‚Äôs O
ok O
to O
feel O
like O
this O
sometimes O
. O


Last O
summer O
before O
I O
started O
Metformin B-DRUG
, O
I O
had O
20 O
kilos O
to O
loose O
( O
which O
is O
a O
lot O
) O
. O

I O
could O
n‚Äôt O
even O
wear O
bras O
, O
I O
had O
to O
wear O
sport O
bras O
. O

I O
had O
to O
attend O
a O
wedding O
, O
and O
I O
remember O
basically O
breaking O
down O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
makeup O
shop O
. O

Weddings O
are O
not O
the O
place O
to O
be O
when O
you O
feel O
like O
this O
. O


What O
I O
want O
to O
say O
is O
: O
it O
‚Äôs O
gets O
better O
eventually O
. O

You O
wo O
n‚Äôt O
always O
be O
or O
feel O
like O
this O
. O

You O
are O
not O
just O
a O
walking O
PCOS O
. O


What O
really O
helped O
me O
with O
anxiety O
and O
insecurity O
is O
the O
Metformin B-DRUG
kicking O
in O
. O

And O
since O
then O
it O
has O
been O
getting O
better O
and O
better O
, O
little O
by O
little O
. O


I O
'm O
not O
OP O
but O
I O
sure O
appreciate O
this O
input O
as O
I O
have O
cervical B-ADR
radiculopathy I-ADR
and O
a O
pending O
MRI O
. O

I O
am O
quite O
a O
bit O
older O
than O
OP O
however O
. O

I O
was O
really O
struck O
by O
your O
advising O
ORAL O
steroids O
as O
opposed O
to O
injections O
as O
that O
is O
what O
I O
have O
been O
requesting O
here O
and O
there O
over O
the O
years O
for O
chronic O
aches B-ADR
and O
pains B-ADR
and O
I O
am O
met O
with O
such O
resistance O
on O
this O
. O

I O
mean O
incredible O
resistance O
. O

Was O
at O
an O
ortho O
visit O
recently O
for O
tennis B-ADR
elbow I-ADR
and O
he O
was O
livid O
that O
I O
asked O
for O
oral O
steroid O
instead O
of O
the O
injection O
he O
advised O
. O

Told O
me O
I O
would O
" O
gain B-ADR
weight I-ADR
" O
( O
on O
6 O
days O
worth O
? O

? O

) O
. O

He O
finally O
wrote O
the O
script O
but O
said O
it O
would O
not O
work O
and O
I O
would O
be O
back O
, O
then O
had O
the O
gall O
to O
give O
me O
a O
pamphlet O
for O
experimental O
PRP O
therapy O
as O
I O
left O
. O

My O
pcp O
before O
this O
visit O
had O
also O
refused O
to O
prescribe O
oral O
steroid O
. O

Both O
docs O
treated O
me O
like O
I O
was O
asking O
for O
opiates O
, O
it O
was O
bizarre O
. O

I O
took O
the O
medrol B-DRUG
dose O
pack O
and O
my O
tennis B-ADR
elbow I-ADR
is O
pretty O
much O
resolved O
. O

It O
worked O
. O

Now O
I O
am O
on O
another O
blast O
of O
prednisone B-DRUG
for O
the O
cervical B-ADR
radiculopathy I-ADR
, O
I O
found O
a O
doc O
who O
had O
no O
problem O
prescribing O
it O
. O

I O
know O
the O
s O
/ O
e O
long O
term O
and O
would O
never O
want O
it O
long O
term O
. O

Anyway O
sorry O
OP O
to O
highjack O
your O
post O
, O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
for O
your O
physical O
pain B-ADR
I O
know O
it O
sucks O
. O


I O
would O
at O
least O
give O
them O
a O
chance O
to O
work O
before O
you O
self O
- O
medicate O
. O

The O
anti O
- O
anxiety O
drugs O
should O
help O
you O
fall O
right O
asleep O
without O
using O
Marijuana O
. O

That O
is O
the O
addiction O
talking O
. O

The O
antidepressants O
could O
take O
up O
to O
a O
month O
to O
make O
a O
noticeable O
difference O
. O



 O
If O
you O
are O
going O
to O
go O
with O
a O
modern O
western O
medical O
approach O
then O
you O
might O
as O
well O
do O
it O
the O
way O
the O
doctor O
would O
prefer O
. O




 O
You O
may O
have O
inspired O
me O
to O
try O
and O
go O
back O
on O
ADs O
. O

I O
have O
yet O
to O
experience O
the O
new O
generation O
of O
medications O
. O

I O
think O
it O
has O
been O
over O
20 O
years O
since O
I O
went O
off O
them O
. O

The O
last O
I O
took O
was O
Prozac B-DRUG
, O
Paxil B-DRUG
, O
and O
Wellbutrin B-DRUG
. O

None O
of O
them O
worked O
. O

The O
best O
was O
when O
I O
was O
on O
a O
much O
older O
drug O
called O
imipramine B-DRUG
. O

A O
doc O
at O
my O
college O
's O
clinic O
put O
me O
on O
it O
. O

After O
I O
transferred O
schools O
I O
was O
never O
able O
to O
convince O
another O
doc O
to O
prescribe O
it O
for O
me O
. O

This O
would O
have O
been O
the O
peak O
of O
the O
pharma O
- O
bros O
and O

days O
. O

Those O
docs O
were O

 O
I O

when O
referring O

without O
being O

they O
are O

probably O
* O
referring O
to O
a O
glucocorticoid O
. O



 O
- O
In O
my O
experience O
people O
tend O
to O
use O
the O
words O
" O

" O
and O
" O
corticosteroids O
" O
when O
talking O
about O

     O

But O
when O
talking O
about O

, O
they O
tend O
not O
to O
use O
the O
word O
" O
glucocorticoid O
" O
and O
just O
use O
the O
more O
general O
term O
" O
corticosteroid O
" O

        O
- O
I O
think O
" O
corticosteroid O
" O
is O
just O
easier O
to O
say O
than O
" O
glucocorticoid O
" O


 O
- O
If O
someone O
is O
talking O
about O
a O
mineralocorticoid O
, O
they O
will O
probably O
describe O
it O
as O
a O
mineralocorticoid O
rather O
than O
as O
a O
steroid O
or O
corticosteroid O

    O
- O

mineralocorticoids O

on O
lisinopril B-DRUG

as O
well O

Maybe O
it O
is O
a O
suggestion O
to O
help O
replace O
the O
negative B-ADR
thoughts I-ADR
with O
active O
positive O
thoughts O
. O

It O
can O
not O
hurt O

A O
lot O
of O
therapies O
focus O
on O
helping O
you O
change O
your O
internal O
narrative O
. O

We O
are O
too O
hard O
on O
ourselves O
. O

The O
entity O
generating O
that O
negativity O
is O
not O
you O
. O

It O
is O
your O
brain O
and O
you O
can O
learn O
to O
tell O
it O
to O
shut O
up O

down O

Sertraline B-DRUG
helps O
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ O

I O
hate O
prednisone B-DRUG
so O
much O
. O

But O
I O
always O
end O
up O
taking O
it O
once O
a O
year O
whenever O
I O
get O
bronchitis B-ADR
. O

Good O
luck O
with O
that O
one O
. O

Prednisone B-DRUG
is O
the O
worst O
tasting O
thing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O

Refused O
to O
refill O
my O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
pills O
unless O
I O
went O
on O
Lipitor B-DRUG
. O

I O
probably O
would O
have O
done O
it O
if O
she O
had O
explained O
it O
to O
me O
better O
, O
but O
holding O
my O

control I-DRUG
hostage O
did O
n‚Äôt O
sit O
right O
with O

The O
study O

says O
they O
took O
no O
other O
diabetic O
information O
into O
account O
besides O
Metformin B-DRUG
use O

Sertraline B-DRUG
actually O
did O
this O
to O
me O
üò≠ O
it O
‚Äôs O
terrible O
. O

During O
summer O
I O
‚Äôd O
walk O
for O
like O
4 O
min O
at O
an O
average O
pace O
and O
I O
would O
drip O
of O
sweat B-ADR
. O

Also O
choosing O
what O
shirt O
to O
wear O
is O
vital O
otherwise O
all O
your O
sweat B-ADR
marks O
will O
show O
üò≠ O

I O
just O
got O
on O
Verapamil B-DRUG
and O
Prednisone B-DRUG
today O
. O

The O
neurologist O
suggested O
, O
that O
my O
issues O
might O
be O
just O
from O
how O
taxing O
the O
attacks O
are O
on O
the O

Thank O
you O

I O
will O
look O
into O
the O
Vit O

regimen O

sounds O
very O
promising O

I O
take O
propanolol B-DRUG

say O
things O
I O
hate O
about O
myself O

Ah O

thank O
god O

Nobody O
told O
me O

I O
think O
my O
story O
is O
unfortunately O
kind O
of O
a O
common O
path O
that O
many O
of O
us O
travel O
. O

( O
oh O
and O
I O
forgot O
I O
tried O
Humira B-DRUG

that O
did O

work O
at O
all O

No O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
skin O
stuff O
- O
I O
did O
when O
I O
was O
a O
teenager O
and O
back O
then O
it O
was O
dismissed O
as O
a O
fungus O
but O
in O
retrospect O
it O
probably O
was O
psoriasis B-ADR
. O

I O
'm O
in O
my O
60s O
now O
and O
have O
just O
PSA O

affecting O
the O
joints O
in O
my O
hands O

back O
issues O

I O
am O
lucky O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
P O
any O
longer O
. O


I O
did O
notice O
a O
significant O
urine B-ADR
output I-ADR
when O
they O
started O
the O
Lasix B-DRUG
but O
the O
urologist O
expressed O
concern O
that O
his O
kidneys O
were O
too O
fatigued O
by O
continued O
usage O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
still O
waiting O
on O
more O
information O
from O
him O
regarding O
his O
continued O
swelling B-ADR
. O

I O
snuck O
out O
a O
bit O
ago O
for O
a O
granola O
bar O
and O
water O
üí¶ O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
happened O
on O
my O
first O
dose O
was O
my O
injection O
site O
was O
a O
big O
itchy B-ADR
welt O
. O

Nothing O
else O
, O
lasted O
a O
day O
. O

No O
side O
effects O
any O
other O
dose O
. O



 O
I O
had O
major O
reactions O
to O
Tecfidera B-DRUG
and O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
though O
, O
everyone O
is O
different O

While O
we O
‚Äôre O
on O
the O
subject O

torsemide B-DRUG
over O
furosemide B-DRUG
all O
day O
every O
day O
as O
well O
. O


I O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
add O
refined O
carbs O
back O
into O
your O
diet O
, O
IR O
and O
PCOS O
symptoms O
will O
worsen O
again O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
not O
only O
weight O
, O
it O
‚Äôs O
also O
about O
diet O
. O

I O
have O
kept O
my O
weight O
down O
and O
diabetes O
away O
, O
but O
when O
I O
stopped O
eating O
properly O
, O
the O
acne B-ADR
and O
other O
stuff O
came O
back O
. O

Insulin O
and O
testosterone O
were O
high O
even O
though O
BG O
and O
A1C O
was O
fine O
, O
and O
I O
was O
going O
to O
have O
to O
go O
back O
on O
Metformin B-DRUG
but O
I O
got O
rid O
of O
the O
snacky O
carbs O
again O
. O


I O
had O
to O
really O
really O
beg O
my O
neuro O
, O
he O
normally O
does O
n‚Äôt O
offer O
it O
but O
I O
pleaded O
. O

Now O
starting O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
has O
to O
be O
delayed O
by O
3 O
months O
for O
shingles B-ADR
vax O
, O
6 O
weeks O
for O
pneumonia B-ADR
vax O
and O
several O
weeks O
for O
covid O
vax O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
a O
balance O
üò´ O

I O
started O
on O
tysabri B-DRUG
being O
JCV+ O
with O
the O
understanding O
that O
I O
would O
switch O
to O
ocrevus B-DRUG
/ O
whatever O
was O
best O
after O
2 O
years O
( O
no O
PML O
cases O
had O
ever O
been O
reported O
before O
the O
2 O
year O
mark O
, O
the O
risk O
goes O
up O
the O
longer O
you O
're O
on O
tysabri B-DRUG
) O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
switching O
at O
13 O
months O
I O
think O
because O
my O
JCV O
titers O
jumped O
up O
extremely O
high O
. O

Like O
you O
, O
my O
doctor O
wanted O
to O
start O
with O
the O
most O
aggressive O
and O
fast O
acting O
treatment O
because O
a O
lot O
of O
stuff O
could O
happen O
in O
the O
months O
you O
're O
waiting O
on O
ocrevus B-DRUG
to O
work O
. O

 

 O
You O
will O
be O
fine O
with O
such O
a O
short O
tysabri B-DRUG
treatment O
! O

I O
honestly O
felt O
the O
best O
when O
I O
was O
on O
it O
and O
I O
miss O
it O
, O
I O
still O
feel O
really O
run O
down O
and O
fatigued B-ADR
daily O
on O
ocrevus B-DRUG
even O
though O
it O
's O
been O
awesome O
at O
stopping O
new O
lesions O
. O


Omg O
I O
feel O
this O
. O

Had O
an O
ambulatory O
alert O

oriented O
patient O
who O
had O
an O
‚Äú O
episode O
‚Äù O
at O
her O
PCP O
appointment O
and O
rode O
in O
via O
EMS O
thinking O
she O
was O
going O
to O
get O
admitted O
. O

She O
told O
the O
ER O
doctor O
she O
skipped O
her O
Lasix B-DRUG
dose O
that O
morning O
because O
it O
makes O
her O
have O
to O
urinate O
too O
much O
so O
naturally O
he O
ordered O
her O
usual O
dose O
of O
Lasix B-DRUG
for O
her O
. O

I O
placed O
her O
on O
a O
Purewick O
catheter O
but O
naturally O
she O
claimed O
it O
did O
n‚Äôt O
work O
and O
soaked O
the O
bed O
. O

I O
asked O
her O
to O
stand O
up O
while O
I O
changed O
the O
sheets O
and O
she O
said O
she O
had O
to O
use O
the O
bathroom O
right O
now O

proceeds O
to O
pee O
in O
the O

It O
is O
my O
job O

take O

change O

I O

 O
Not O
my O
proudest O
moments O

I O
began O
metformin B-DRUG
after O
my O
hysterectomy O

I O
tried O
Lyrica B-DRUG

Prednisone B-DRUG
with O
no O
success O
and O
bad O
side O
effects O

I O
'm O
now O
settled O
on O
Doxycycline B-DRUG

a O

Works O

üòä O

I O
‚Äôm O
okay O
starting O
with O
tysabri B-DRUG
, O
i O
‚Äôm O
only O
worried O
about O
PML B-ADR
and O
i O
was O
curious O
if O
other O
people O
have O
done O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Would O
you O
say O
it O
‚Äôs O
superior O
to O
ocrevus B-DRUG
? O

The O
relapse O
rate O
and O
data O
from O
clinical O
trials O
seem O
pretty O
similar O
. O


Basically O
your O
gut O
slows O
down O
, O
medications O
stay O
around O
longer O
. O

  O
Prednisone B-DRUG
causes O
fluid O

weight B-ADR
gain I-ADR

Should O
have O
went O
lower O
dose O

I O
am O
on O
lovastatin B-DRUG

was O
on O

it O

approves O

me O

them O

 O
From O
my O
understanding O
, O
  O
if O
you O
are O
compensated O
statins O
are O
mostly O
considered O
safe O
and O
can O
actually O
help O
with O
portal O
pressure O
a O
bit O
. O



 O
If O
decompensated O
, O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
trickier O
with O
the O
toxicity B-ADR
and O
dose O
, O
etc O
. O



 O
There O
does O
seem O
to O
be O
mixed O

at O

you O
can O

just O
fix O

  O
Your O

that O
only O

direi O

chiedere O

chi O
ti O
ha O

Absolutely O
, O
this O
is O
somewhere O
where O
we O
need O
bigger O
changes O
to O
the O
food O

see O

. O

It O
‚Äôs O
not O
a O
lack O
of O
education O
for O
most O
people O
. O

I O
have O
seen O
more O
than O
my O
share O
of O
hospitalized O
patients O
with O
a O
CHF O

have O
their O
families O
sneak O
in O
burger/ O
fries O
/ O
pizza O

. O

because O
they O
do O
n‚Äôt O
want O
to O
eat O
‚Äú O
gross O
hospital O
food O
‚Äù O
. O

I O
thought O
one O
of O
our O
hospitalists O
was O
going O
to O
stroke B-ADR
out O
one O
day O
arguing O
with O
a O
patient O
who O
he O
found O
happily O
eating O
fries O
while O
needing O
hefty O
doses O
of O
lasix B-DRUG
. O



 O
We O
can O
educate O
people O
all O
day O
, O
but O
the O
reality O
is O
unless O
they O
REALLY O
want O
to O
make O
changes O
its O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

Processed O
and O
fast O
foods O
are O
cheap O
, O
convenient O
, O

tasty O
. O

They O
need O
to O
be O
made O
more O
expensive O

less O

. O

A O
better O
work O

you O

Are O
they O
taking O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
or O
another O
ACE O
inhibitor O
? O

I O
have O
had O
a O
cough B-ADR
for O
YEARS O
from O
that O
and O
asthma B-ADR
. O


I O
think O
the O
amlodipine B-DRUG
and O
lisinopril B-DRUG
I O
‚Äôm O
on O
is O
keeping O
me O
at O
a O
110 O
- O
125 O
range O

But O
sometimes O
I O
check O
first O
reading O
I O
get O
130/66 O

Is O
that O
normal O
? O


Then O
after O
that O
I O
check O
again O
I O
get O
125/68 O
. O

120/70 O

My O
diastolic O
is O
absolutely O
normal O

Just O
remembered O
this O
so O
I O
'm O
tossing O
in O
my O
experience O
. O



 O
My O
pharmacist O
transferred O
a O
script O
for O
furosemide B-DRUG
from O
another O
pharmacy O
. O

I O
took O
the O
call O
from O
the O
patient O
. O

Later O
that O
day O
, O
the O
husband O
was O
sent O
in O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
script O
. O

Luckily O
I O
was O
working O
the O
pickup O
window O
because O
I O
grabbed O
the O
ready O
script O
and O
then O
noticed O
the O
med O
name O
which O
I O
thought O
was O
different O
than O
I O
had O
written O
down O
earlier O
, O
but O
questioned O
my O
memory O
until O
I O
read O
the O
sig O
. O



 O
They O
filled O
fluoxetine B-DRUG
40 O
mg O
take O
1qid O
prn O
. O

It O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
furosemide B-DRUG
40 O
mg O
with O
the O
same O
sig O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
not O
the O
best O
with O
social O
situations O
, O
but O
I O
figured O
it O
was O
probably O
best O
if O
I O
just O
asked O
for O
some O
more O
time O
and O
had O
my O
pharmacist O
correct O
it O
instead O
of O
explaining O
the O
med O
error O
to O
him O
. O

I O
literally O
said O
" O
oh O
I O
'm O
so O
sorry O
I O
just O
realized O
we O
made O
a O
tiny O
boo O
- O
boo O
. O

If O
I O
can O
have O
5 O
more O
minutes O
we O
'll O
be O
good O
to O
go O
" O
. O

Like O
I O
was O
really O
trying O
to O
downplay O
how O
seriously O
worried O
and O
simultaneously O
relieved O
I O
was O
about O
catching O
the O
error O
. O



 O
It O
did O
n't O
go O
out O
to O
the O
patient O
, O
but O
it O
very O
nearly O
did O
so O
I O
'm O
counting O
it O
as O
an O
error O
on O
the O
pharmacist O
's O
part O
. O


Slightly O
smaller O
than O
the O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
I O
have O
had O
to O
take O
once O
a O
day O
since O
2016 O
and O
will O
have O
to O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
. O


  O
I O
've O
got O
Medicare O
parts O
A O

B O
and O
it O
covers O
my O
lisinopril B-DRUG
. O


I O
experienced O
the O
same O
once O
I O
started O
on O
sertraline B-DRUG
in O
general O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
sick B-ADR
and O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
felt O
like O
it O
got O
worse O
. O

this O
lasted O
for O
about O
2 O
weeks O
but O
I O
think O
it O
was O
my O
body O
adjusting O
to O
everything O
, O
could O
be O
same O
for O
you O

Try O
and O
stick O
with O
the O
medication O
for O
a O
while O
longer O
then O
have O
another O

discuss O

there O

breathing I-ADR
all O

i O
went O

the O
doctors O

they O
gave O
me O
propranolol B-DRUG

it O
worked O

i O
trust O
me O

anything O

help O
( O

nothing O

i O
had O
enough O

keep O
me O

it O

Long O
story O

you O

i O

it O

I O

Do O
n't O
give O
up O
and O
do O
n't O
be O
scared O

the O
key O
is O
communicating O

those O
that O
can O
help O

Hey O
! O

I O
've O
been O
feeling O
exactly O
the O

been O
on O
50 O

a O
half O
weeks O

around O
the O

started O
waking O
up O

horrendous O
anxiety B-ADR
every O
morning O
for O
no O
reason O
at O
all O

I O
'm O
the O
same O
as O
you O
where O
it O
gets O
better O
throughout O
the O
day O
but O
the O
mornings O
are O
rough O

I O
've O
had O
one O
day O
where O
there O
was O
n't O
any O
anxiety B-ADR
at O
all O
since O
this O
started O
and O
one O
where O
it O
was O
n't O
too O
bad O
. O

Hopefully O
we O
'll O
be O
properly O
adjusted O
soon O

it O
's O

I O

at O
this O
stage O
though O
it O
's O
normal O
for O
things O
to O
get O
a O

worse O
before O
they O

what O

up O

All O
it O
suggests O
is O
that O
your O

will O
do O
for O
you O
before O
anything O
else O
. O

You O
can O
shorten O
your O
life O

you O
ca O
n't O
extend O
it O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
sorry O
to O
learn O
about O
your O
reaction B-ADR
to O
statins O
. O

I O
had O
a O
minor O
problem O
with O
them O
myself O
, O
possible O
rhabdomyolysis B-ADR
, O
but O
to O
be O
honest O
it O
could O
also O
have O
been O
due O
to O
the O
effects O
of O
over O
- O
exercise O
. O

The O
statins O
were O
changed O
for O
a O
newer O
type O
and O
I O
've O
not O
had O
problems O
since O
. O



 O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
the O
significance O
of O
the O
10 O
% O
in O
your O
arteries O
. O

I O
assume O
it O
is O
the O
result O
of O
a O
scan O
? O

10 O
% O
plaque B-ADR
buildup I-ADR
? O

I O
take O
40 O
mg O
Atorvastatin B-DRUG
daily O
. O

It O
reduces B-ADR
my I-ADR
cholesterol I-ADR
level O
to O
6 O
mmol O
/ O
L O
which O
is O
n't O
brilliant O
but O
acceptable O
. O

I O
reckon O
exercise O
is O
probably O
the O
most O
important O
aspect O
of O
lifespan O
and O
quality O
of O
life O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
impact O
of O

 O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O

to O
your O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
just O
share O
some O
thoughts O
with O
him O
without O
it O
seeming O
as O
if O
I O
was O
personally O
criticizing O
him O

It O
must O
seem O
to O
you O
that O
he O
is O
wilful O

that O
he O
does O
n't O

you O

Just O
any O

honestly O
amazed O
here O
how O
many O
people O
are O
this O
inconvenienced O
by O
their O

The O
real O
issue O
is O
if O

a O

. O



 O
Get O
some O
better O

 O
I O
have O
n't O
risked O
it O
because O
I O
already O
have O
dry B-ADR
eyes I-ADR
, O
and O
if O
they O
got O
worse O
it O
would O
impact O
me O
pretty O
severely O

The O

‚Äôs O
okay O
to O
drink O
a O
little O
on O
Zoloft B-DRUG
but O
a O
party O
like O
that O
would O
be O
hard O
on O
you O
even O
without O
any O
meds O

 O
I O
was O
young O
once O
too O
, O
I O
get O
it O
, O
but O
silly O
question O
dude O
. O


If O
your O
mother O
is O
averaging O

clinically O

 O
My O

on O
a O
calcium O

a O
beta O

a O

extremely O

is O
n't O
very O
stressed O

Some O
people O
just O
have O
bad O
luck O
with O
these O

 O
My O

Genetics O
are O
a O
bitch O
. O


I O
got O
the O
same O
effects O
when O
I O
started O
Prednisone B-DRUG
and O
immediately O
stopped O
. O

Do O
n't O
ever O
want O
to O
take O
it O
again O
. O

I O
think O
if O
it O
's O
possible O
for O
you O
I O
would O
stop O
taking O
it O
completely O
( O
taper O
off O
) O
. O


Are O
you O
taking O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
? O

I O
took O
this O
med O
for O
hypertension B-ADR
and O
it O
gave O
me O
the O
worst O
dry B-ADR
cough I-ADR
. O

In O
some O
, O
the O
cough B-ADR
is O
more O
pronounced O
when O
public O
speaking O
or O
stressed O
. O


Atorvastatin B-DRUG

it O
took O
me O
about O
6 O
months O
to O
even O
out O
on O
humira B-DRUG

Why O
not O
colchicine B-DRUG
? O

I O
was O
also O
afraid O
of O
prednisone B-DRUG
. O

Doc O
gave O
me O
colchicine B-DRUG
and O
it O
is O
a O
miracle O
. O

Anytime O
a O
flare O
starts O
, O
I O
take O
as O
prescribed O
and O
it O
‚Äôs O
gone O
the O
next O
day O
. O


Honestly O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
for O
3y O
now O
and O
have O
had O
covid O
this O
past O
December O
. O

Obviously O
it O
sucked O
and O
I O
would O
n‚Äôt O
recommend O
. O

It O
took O
me O
out O
for O
5 O
days O
, O
on O
day O
7 O
I O
was O
back O
to O
work O
. O

It O
did O
n‚Äôt O
kill O
me O
. O


i O
do O
n‚Äôt O
know O
if O
this O
is O
necessarily O
true O
, O
i O
had O
bad O
anxiety B-ADR
and O
prozac B-DRUG
has O
definitely O
lessened O
it O

  O
A O
loved O
one O
is O
on O
Propanolol B-DRUG
for O
migraine B-ADR
prevention O
and O
his O
rescue O
cocktail O
includes O
alleve B-DRUG
. O


I O
think O
I O
will O
check O
his O
heart O
rate O
after O
he O
gets O
his O
rescue O
meds O
next O
time O
. O


Sounds O
like O
he O
had O
a O
heart B-ADR
attack I-ADR
. O



 O
Not O
saying O
this O
is O
the O
case O
with O
him O
, O
however O
, O
many O
people O
ignore O
their O
heart O
and O
have O
no O
clue O
about O
the O
health O
of O
their O
coronary O
arteries O
. O

They O
may O
think O
, O
" O
I O
'm O
healthy O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
overweight O
, O
I O
exercise O
and O
have O
low O
cholesterol O
, O
my O
heart O
is O
fine O
. O

" O


 O
\~50 O
% O
of O
heart O
attacks O
occur O
in O
people O
without O
high O
cholesterol O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
47 O
and O
have O
to O
take O
lipitor B-DRUG
for O
my O
cholesterol O
because O
no O
matter O
what O
I O
do O
or O
did O
, O
I O
could O
get O
it O
down O
to O
a O
certain O
level O
. O

But O
, O
high O
cholesterol O
does O
not O
mean O
blocked O
coronary O
arteries O
. O



 O
Years O
ago O
when O
I O
first O
started O
seeing O
the O
preventative O
cardiologist O
, O
we O
got O
a O
CT O
Angiography O
( O
CTA O
) O
with O
contrast O
ordered O
and O
it O
was O
clean O
as O
a O
whistle O
. O



 O
I O
have O
been O
doing O
yearly O
CT O
calcium O
score O
tests O
out O
of O
pocket O
( O
$ O
80 O
) O
ever O
since O
. O



 O
I O
feel O
for O
his O
kids O
and O
family O
. O

Very O
sad O
. O


Man O
, O
when O
I O
got O
out O
of O
the O
Corps O
in O
2011 O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
do O
shit O
but O
drink O
and O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
. O



 O
It O
's O
so O
easy O
to O
go O
to O
hell O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
start O
to O
turn O
it O
around O
until O
2019 O
. O

Just O
got O
ta O
make O
a O
life O
change O
, O
not O
because O
people O
tell O
you O
to O
, O
but O
because O
you O
only O
have O
one O
, O
and O
your O
body O
is O
your O
vehicle O
for O
maximizing O
what O
you O
get O
from O
it O
. O



 O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
end O
up O
like O
my O
father O
. O

Obese O
, O
on O
Lipitor B-DRUG
, O
miserable O
as O
fuck O
, O
disgusting O

What O
kind O
of O
musckele O

determines O
its O

Ortho O

  O
I O
know O
many O
of O
my O
colleagues O
who O
are O
eager O
to O
pull O
the O
trigger O
given O
how O
much O
they O
help O
after O
acute O
injuries O
and O
exacerbation O
, O
again O
being O
case O
dependent O
. O

Muscle O
relaxers O
I O
tend O
to O
most O
use O
post O
op O
, O
either O
flexeril B-DRUG
or O
robaxin B-DRUG
. O

I O
tend O
to O
be O
conservative O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
medication O
in O
clinic O
, O
but O
during O
fellowship O
( O
in O
the O
same O
area O
) O
I O
saw O
prednisone B-DRUG
tapers O
being O
handed O
out O
like O
candy O
on O
Halloween O
. O


It O
‚Äôs O
one O
brand O
of O
automated O
drug O
dispensing O
cabinet O
systems O

  O
I O
‚Äôve O
seen O
these O
and O
similar O
different O

used O
for O
floor O
stock O

 O
Pharmacy O
stocks O
the O

  O
They O
have O
a O
computerized O
system O
for O
tracking O
the O
drugs O
removed O
from O
the O
cabinet O
. O

  O
Nurse O
accesses O
the O
cabinet O
via O
a O
touchscreen O
by O
inputting O
his O

  O
For O
the O

  O
normally O
the O

must O

more O

I O
would O
say O
most O
are O

by O
generic O

. O

  O
I O
‚Äôve O
seen O
a O
lot O
of O
criticism O
from O
non O
- O
American O
nurses O
of O
‚Äú O
why O
do O
n‚Äôt O
American O
nurses O
use O
generic O
drug O
names O
? O

‚Äù O
But O
that O
‚Äôs O
an O
oversimplification O
. O

  O
Nurses O
working O
in O
specific O
areas O
are O
familiar O
with O
generic O
as O
well O
as O
brand O
names O
for O
the O
drugs O
commonly O
used O
in O
that O
area O

 O
When O
enough O
letters O
of O
the O

‚Äôs O

have O
been O
entered O
for O
the O

a O
drawer O

  O
Usually O
the O
drugs O
are O
stored O
in O
the O

a O
unit O

( O
such O
as O
Furosemide B-DRUG

not O
already O
drawn O

unless O
it O
‚Äôs O
supplied O
by O
the O
manufacturer O
in O
a O
commercially O
prefilled O

  O
The O

after O

 O
The O

up O

 O
Every O

the O

who O
removed O

the O

  O
Also O
what O
time O
it O

how O
many O

I O
do O
take O
propanolol B-DRUG
now O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
measured O
my O
pulse O
a O
lot O
since O
I O
feel O
better O

But O
my O
resting O
HR O
is O
down O
to O
about O
60 O
- O
75 O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
get O
extreme O
pulse B-ADR
spikes I-ADR
anymore O
! O


If O
I O
have O
n't O
lost O
count O
I O
am O
on O
my O
third O
dose O
of O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
. O

I O
like O
not O
having O
to O
think O
about O
it O
. O

I O
actually O
switched O
from O
Gilenya B-DRUG
because O
I O
was O
still O
getting O
new O
spinal B-ADR
lesions I-ADR
and O
my O
wbc O
was O
in O
the O
toilet O
. O

Overall O
my O
numbers O
have O
gone O
up O
and O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
new O
lesions O
since O
starting O
( O
granted O
that O
is O
pretty O
specific O
to O
me O
. O

) O


 O
In O
regards O
to O
the O
infusion O
itself O
, O
Like O
most O
people O
it O
is O
nice O
to O
only O
have O
to O
think O
about O
it O
2x O
a O
year O
. O

They O
just O
got O
approved O
for O
faster O
infusion O
so O
i O
think O
it O
is O
like O
~3 O
- O
3.5 O
hours O
between O
solumedrol B-DRUG
, O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
and O
saline B-DRUG
. O

They O
load O
me O
up O
on O
benadryl B-DRUG
beforehand O
so O
my O
day O
is O
usually O
shot O
after O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
drive O
home O
in O
part O
because O
of O
that O
. O

I O
try O
and O
be O
more O
careful O
around O
infusion O
since O
it O
does O
suppress O
the O
immune O
system O
, O
for O
ex O
I O
had O
plan O
my O
covid O
and O
flu O
shots O
around O
it O
. O

I O
never O
had O
any O
side O
effects O
on O
it O
, O
but O
I O
could O
just O
be O
lucky O
" O
knock O
on O
wood O
" O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
tho O
. O


That O
is O
a O
super O
strange O
response O
from O
a O
rheumatologist O
as O
lupus B-ADR
can O
change O
pretty O
quickly O
. O

  O
New O
doctor O
may O
be O
needed O
or O
you O
just O
need O
to O
go O
in O
for O
a O
visit O
to O
show O
them O
what O
you O
mean O
. O

It O
sometimes O
take O
a O
while O
for O
a O
rheumatologist O
to O
get O
up O
to O
speed O
with O
a O
particular O
patient O
and O
their O
rhythms O
( O
how O
often O
they O
flare B-ADR
, O
what O
their O
pain B-ADR
tolerance O
is O
, O
etc O
. O

) O
, O


 O
Prednisone B-DRUG
is O
a O
double O
edged O
sword O
no O
doubt O
but O
hopefully O
they O
can O
pair O
it O
with O
something O
else O
so O
you O
can O
be O
on O
a O
lowest O
dose O
possible O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
start O
feeling O
better O
. O


Yeah O
, O
I O
had O
some O
walking B-ADR
issues I-ADR
due O
to O
mine O
, O
which O
did O
n‚Äôt O
help O
my O
balance O
at O
all O
. O

But O
my O
whole O
thing O
was O
I O
kept O
running O
into O
stuff O
. O

People O
around O
me O
noticed O
too O

Now O

I O
actually O

more O
balanced O
and O
no O
longer O
has O
issues O
walking O

It O
‚Äôs O
a O
lot O
better O
. O


Lisinopril B-DRUG
, O
5 O
mg O
( O
low O
dose O
) O
was O
very O
effective O
for O
me O
in O
controlling O
BP O
. O

  O
I O
no O
longer O
take O
this O
anymore O
due O
to O
BP O
normalizing O
. O



 O
Also O
took O
80 O
mg O
propanolol B-DRUG
( O
bad O
side O
effects O
) O
, O
such O
as O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
dizziness B-ADR
, O
issues O
with O
hot O
showers O
. O

Would O
not O
recommend O
. O

I O
am O
only O
taking O
60 O
mg O
now O
, O
but O
still O
looking O
to O
get O
off O
this O
. O



 O
Biggest O
factors O
was O
controlling O
diet O
and O
lifestyle O
. O

Lost O
like O
30 O
lbs O
, O
went O
from O
overweight O
to O
being O
within O
the O
" O
healthy O
range O
" O
for O
my O
height O
, O
age O
( O
6 O
' O
0 O
" O
, O
29 O
M O
) O
. O

Also O
avoided O
adding O
excess O
salt O
in O
my O
diet O
. O


Yes O
, O
me O
too O
. O

This O
post O
actually O
is O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
had O
a O
better O
day O
today O
than O
the O
past O
few O
because O
I O
was O
so O
stressed O
about O
this O
part O
of O
starting O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
. O

Everyone O
is O
reassuring O
me O
that O
I O
‚Äôm O
most O
likely O
not O
gon O
na O
die O
from O
a O
cold O
lol O
. O

Someone O
on O
another O
one O
of O
my O
posts O
made O
me O
feel O
that O
( O
though O
they O
had O
good O
intentions O
) O
so O
I O
guess O
that O
‚Äôs O
the O
bad O
part O
of O
it O
, O
but O
overall O
it O
‚Äôs O
good O
and O
helpful O
. O


I O
've O
felt O
like O
this O
, O
and O
even O
more O
so O
before O
I O
started O
sertraline B-DRUG
. O

I O
've O
found O
that O
if O
I O
sleep O
through O
my O
alarms O
or O
wake O
up O
and O
go O
back O
to O
sleep O
throughout O
alarms O
it O
makes O
me O
feel O
so O
much O
worse O
and O
I O
usually O
get O
a O
headache B-ADR
too O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
you O
do O
this O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
maybe O
try O
a O
few O
days O
waking O
up O
and O
getting O
out O
of O
bed O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
alarms O
goes O
off O
, O
I O
keep O
my O
phone O
away O
from O
my O
desk O
so O
I O
have O
to O
get O
up O
and O
then O
I O
usually O
sit O
at O
my O
desk O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
to O
wake O
up O
slowly O
and O
drink O
some O
water O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
that O
's O
any O
help O
, O
feel O
free O
to O
DM O
me O

Lisinopril B-DRUG
is O
literally O
kicking O
my O

. O

  O
I O
've O
only O
been O
on O
it O
since O
last O
October O
, O
and O
for O
the O
first O
2 O
months O
on O
10 O
mg O
, O
I O
was O
totally O
fine O
. O

Then O
the O
dizziness B-ADR
and O
feeling O
of O
floating O
on O
water O
began O
. O

  O
So O
we O
cut O
it O
down O
to O
5 O
mg O
, O
dizziness B-ADR
has O
somewhat O
subsided O
, O
but O
I O
have O
extreme O
vertigo B-ADR
now O
. O

Always O
grabbing O

( O

And O
the O

always O
constant O

  O

  O
Hard O
to O

on O
simple O
things O
even O
at O
work O

  O
TBH O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
else O
to O
do O
. O

  O
I O
'm O
afraid O
to O
switch O
to O
something O
else O
bc O
of O
unwanted O
side O
effects O
. O


I O
say O
this O
a O
lot O
. O

For O
several O
different O
reasons O
. O

But O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
to O
emphasize O
is O
this O
" O
what O
the O
fuck O
were O
they O
thinking O
" O
conversation O
actually O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
conversation O
rather O
than O
a O
rant O
/ O
temper O
tantrum O
. O

I O
had O
an O
attending O
that O
would O
say O
this O
repeatedly O
; O
it O
was O
more O
of O
a O
decision O
paralysis O
fixation O
because O
they O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
, O
and O
this O
was O
their O
signal O
they O
wanted O
someone O
else O
to O
take O
the O
reins O
from O
them O
. O



 O
A O
- O
Sometimes O
what O
they O
did O
makes O
perfect O
sense O
, O
I O
just O
did O
n't O
know O
it O
was O
an O
acceptable O
or O
effective O
treatment O
. O

By O
asking O
this O
seemingly O
dumb O
question O
out O
loud O
, O
sometimes O
a O
random O
pharmacist O
will O
pipe O
up O
and O
tell O
me O
what O
they O
did O
is O
more O
or O
less O
an O
acceptable O
standard O
of O
care O
. O



 O
B O
- O
I O
actually O
do O
need O
to O
know O
why O
they O
did O
something O
if O
it O
turns O
out O
to O
have O
potentially O
caused O
harm O
, O
and O
also O
what O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
do O
or O
thought O
they O
were O
dealing O
with O
. O

Both O
in O
order O
to O
know O
how O
to O
address O
and O
fix O
it O
, O
and O
also O
how O
to O
frame O
my O
documentation O
. O



 O
C O
- O
I O
probably O
know O
the O
other O
physicians O
involved O
, O
might O
even O
have O
gone O
to O
residency O
together O
. O

I O
'm O
trying O
to O
give O
them O
an O
audible O
benefit O
of O
the O
doubt O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
believe O
that O
I O
've O
also O
made O
mistakes O
of O
the O
same O
, O
or O
bigger O
caliber O
, O
but O
never O
knew O
. O

In O
this O
scenario O
" O
what O
the O
fuck O
were O
they O
thinking O
" O
is O
almost O
more O
of O
a O
prayer O
than O
a O

More O

If O
the O

The O

I O

But O
it O
's O
not O
as O
intuitive O
, O
so O
as O
part O
of O
the O
process O
you O
have O
to O
muddle O
through O
it O
, O
trying O

time O

It O
's O
honestly O
more O
of O
a O
teaching O

than O
the O
classic O

My O

It O
‚Äôs O
hard O

I O
've O
been O
thinking O
for O
years O
that O
more O
Boomers O
are O
going O
to O
die O
alone O
and O
disconnected O
from O
their O
kids O
than O
any O
generation O
before O
... O
on O
top O
of O
that O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
just O
a O
few O
years O
away O
from O
realizing O
that O
after O
all O
a O
lifetime O
of O
hard O
work O
and O
having O
advantages O
their O
children O
never O
did O
, O
they O
STILL O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
afford O
to O
retire O
fully O
. O

They O
may O
retire O
, O
but O
odds O
are O
they O
will O
be O
forced O
back O
into O
working O
before O
the O
Lipitor B-DRUG
stops O
working O
. O


I O
'm O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
. O

I O
'm O
vaccinated O
and O
boosted O
against O
Covid O
, O
but O
I O
caught O
it O
in O
January O
. O

Sick B-ADR
for O
about O
9 O
days O
, O
recovered O
just O
fine O
:) O
other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
sick B-ADR
at O
all O
since O
starting O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
in O
2018 O
. O


I O
'm O
sorry O
man O
, O
but O
the O
meds O
are O
gon O
na O
conflict O
with O
the O
DMT O
completely O
. O

  O
You O
wo O
n't O
even O
be O
able O
to O
see O
visuals O
, O
let O
alone O
breakthrough O
with O
much O
Zoloft B-DRUG
in O
your O
system O
. O



 O
That O
said O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
insane O
the O
experience O
can O
be O
, O
it O
's O
not O
worth O
trying O
for O
, O
at O
all O
, O
if O
the O
means O
will O
push O
you O
to O
the O
edge O
of O
suicide B-ADR
. O

  O
Keep O
up O
your O
meds O
, O
and O
later O
in O
life O
, O
if O
your O
conditions O
change O
, O
try O
again O
then O
. O

 

 O
Plus O
, O
I O
just O
so O
happen O
to O
be O
starting O
on O
a O
project O
right O
now O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
recreate O
DMT O
's O
effects O
without O
chemical O
intervention O
, O
( O
which O
would O
be O
absolutely O
INSANE O
if O
it O
works O
) O
, O
and O
could O
soon O
serve O
as O
a O
workaround O
for O
you O
, O
so O
hmu O
if O
you O
're O
interested O
. O



 O
Sorry O
about O
the O
disappointing O
news O
, O
but O
i O
hope O
this O
can O
help O
you O
! O


Best O
thing O
to O
do O
is O
get O
metformin B-DRUG
. O

Has O
other O
health O
benefits O
too O
and O
you O
can O
buy O
it O
cheap O
in O
overseas O
pharmacies O
. O


Otherwise O
, O
get O
some O
berberine B-DRUG
. O

The O
research O
behind O
it O
's O
ability O
to O
lower B-ADR
blood I-ADR
sugar I-ADR
and O
insulin B-ADR
sensitivity I-ADR
is O
pretty O
strong O
, O
even O
compared O
to O
medications O
like O
metformin B-DRUG
. O


Likely O
a O
med O
side O
effect O
, O
could O
be O
from O
either O
medication O
. O

Could O
also O
be O
heartburn B-ADR
/ O
acid B-ADR
reflux I-ADR
. O

Zoloft B-DRUG
can O
cause O
that O
too O
. O



  O
If O
it O
continues O
, O
you O
can O
call O
your O
doc O
but O
if O
the O
rest O
of O
you O
is O
fine O
, O
it O
‚Äôs O
likely O
just O
fine O
. O


Lipitor B-DRUG

Thanks O
for O
the O
advice O
. O

Unfortunately O
i O
m O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
atm O
so O
any O
chance O
of O
me O
taking O
live O
vaccines O
has O
gone O
for O
now O
‚Ä¶ O
hopefully O
can O
at O
a O
time O
they O
can O
wean O
me O
off O
biologics O
but O
could O
be O
wishful O
thinking O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
remember O
age O
exactly O
, O
but O
an O
older O
chihuahua O
! O

! O

Maybe O
around O
10 O
. O

She O
still O
had O
her O
teeth O
lol O
Went O
to O
regular O
vet O
not O
long O
ago O
for O
a O
cough B-ADR
and O
started O
on O
suppressants O
‚Ä¶ O
. O

They O
ran O
out O
of O
suppressants O
and O
cough B-ADR
worsened O
so O
they O
came O
to O
us O
on O
emergency O
where O
we O
did O
chest O
rads O
. O

They O
declined O
a O
cardio O
work O
up O
and O
went O
home O
on O
palliative O
care O
, O
but O
we O
did O
give O
a O
lasix B-DRUG
injection O
! O

My O
guess O
is O
CHF O
. O


Hey O
OP O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
29 O
and O
was O
diagnosed O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
ago O
. O



 O
I O
really O
relate O
to O
what O
you O
‚Äôve O
written O
here O
( O
and O
clearly O
other O
people O
do O
too O
) O
. O

I O
actually O
had O
to O
leave O
this O
sub O
because O
of O
all O
of O
the O
numbers O
and O
carb O
/ O
calorie O
counting O
. O

I O
have O
a O
history O
of O
disordered B-ADR
eating I-ADR
and O
I O
find O
it O
incredibly O
triggering O
. O

I O
also O
struggle O
with O
depression B-ADR
, O
and O
the O
idea O
of O
not O
being O
able O
to O
eat O
the O
foods O
I O
loved O
made O
me O
feel O
like O
I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
want O
to O
live O
anymore O
. O



 O
I O
‚Äôm O
back O
here O
because O
I O
often O
feel O
isolated O
with O
this O
disease O
and O
wondered O
if O
there O
were O
others O
who O
found O
the O
‚Äú O
traditional O
‚Äù O
approach O
to O
treating O
diabetes O
( O
especially O
type O
2 O
) O
to O
be O
bordering O
on O
a O
sanctioned O
eating B-ADR
disorder I-ADR
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
really O
glad O
you O
posted O
this O
. O

It O
makes O
me O
feel O
a O
lot O
less O
alone O
. O



 O
When O
I O
was O
first O
diagnosed O
I O
really O
restricted O
my O
food O
. O

It O
was O
horrible O
. O

I O
was O
cranky O
and O
anxious B-ADR
and O
depressed B-ADR
and O
obsessed O
with O
calories O
and O
carbs O
. O

It O
was O
terrible O
for O
my O
mental O
health O
. O

My O
A1C O
went O
down O
significantly O
, O
but O
I O
think O
most O
of O
that O
was O
because O
I O
was O
given O
metformin B-DRUG
and O
I O
was O
taking O
it O
as O
prescribed O
. O



 O
I O
started O
learning O
about O
intuitive O
eating O
, O
which O
is O
possible O
even O
with O
diabetes O
! O

I O
‚Äôm O
not O
perfect O
at O
it O
. O

But O
it O
‚Äôs O
what O
I O
try O
to O
do O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
not O
restricting O
anything O
anymore O
. O

I O
try O
to O
* O
add O
* O
more O
things O
to O
my O
diet O
rather O
than O
restricting O
. O

So O
I O
‚Äôm O
trying O
to O
eat O
more O
veggies O
and O
more O
fiber O
. O

But O
if O
I O
am O
not O
able O
to O
do O
it O
, O
I O
try O
not O
to O
beat O
myself O
up O
about O
it O
. O



 O
I O
just O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
pharmacist O
. O

I O
no O
longer O
weigh O
myself O
, O
but O
I O
do O
take O
my O
blood O
sugar O
most O
mornings O
. O

She O
says O
the O
numbers O
are O
‚Äú O
within O
range O
‚Äù O
and O
to O
keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
. O

Even O
though O
she O
says O
I O
‚Äôm O
doing O
well O
, O
I O
still O
find O
the O
talks O
with O
her O
nerve O
wracking O
and O
hate O
talking O
about O
the O
numbers O
. O

But O
she O
‚Äôs O
the O
medical O
professional O
here O
, O
and O
if O
she O
says O
to O
keep O
doing O
what O
I O
‚Äôm O
doing O
, O
I O
‚Äôll O
follow O
her O
advice O
. O



 O
I O
wonder O
if O
there O
‚Äôs O
a O
way O
we O
can O
start O
a O
small O
community O
of O
folks O
who O
feel O
similarly O
. O

It O
would O
be O
wonderful O
to O
hear O
from O
others O
who O
are O
going O
through O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Would O
anyone O
be O
interested O
? O


There O
is O
more O
anecdotal O
evidence O
now O
( O
within O
the O
last O
~2 O
years O
) O
from O
women O
who O
did O
n't O
know O
they O
were O
pregnant O
very O
early O
on O
and O
got O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
infusions O
, O
or O
got O
pregnant O
very O
shortly O
after O
, O
that O
it O
is O
likely O
fine O
. O

So O
the O
advice O
has O
changed O
somewhat O
. O


I O
've O
been O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
for O
2 O
1/2 O
yrs O
now O
. O

I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
negative O
effects O
. O

And O
I O
aced O
my O
last O
colonoscopy O
. O


I O
'm O
relatively O
new O
. O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
in O
early O
April O
. O

I O
was O
in O
very O
bad O
shape O
, O
and O
it O
really O
came O
on O
quick O
. O

I O
started O
humira B-DRUG
about O
2 O
months O
ago O
. O

It O
can O
vary O
day O
to O
day O
, O
but O
for O
the O
past O
few O
weeks O
my O
situation O
is O
much O
better O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
for O
a O
follow O
- O
up O
in O
July O
, O
but O
assuming O
there O
's O
no O
ongoing O
damage O
, O
I O
'd O
say O
the O
humira B-DRUG
is O
doing O
well O
enough O
. O



 O
At O
my O
worst O
I O
could O
n't O
sleep O
because O
my O
shoulders O
hurt O
too O
much O
to O
get O
comfortable O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
- O
30 O
minutes O
. O

Getting O
in O
and O
out O
of O
bed O
was O
tough O
. O

Bending O
down O
to O
pick O
something O
up O
off O
the O
floor O
was O
very O
painful B-ADR
. O

My O
wife O
convinced O
me O
to O
take O
a O
bath O
to O
loosen O
the O
joints O
, O
but O
I O
realized O
I O
could O
n't O
get O
out O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
arm O
strength O
because O
my O
joints B-ADR
hurt I-ADR
so O
bad O
. O

Took O
me O
about O
10 O
minutes O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
physics O
, O
but O
if O
I O
had O
n't O
I O
honestly O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
I O
would O
get O
out O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
keep O
a O
daily O
" O
pain B-ADR
journal O
" O
for O
my O
Dr O
, O
but O
I O
usually O
forget O
to O
write O
entries O
because O
things O
are O
mostly O
ok O
. O


I O
was O
told O
to O
watch O
out O
for O
that O
too O
because O
it O
's O
something O
that O
might O
lower B-ADR
my I-ADR
blood I-ADR
pressure I-ADR
a O
little O
, O
and O
it O
would O
n't O
be O
the O
first O
time O
I O
got O
heart O
palpitations B-ADR
from O
a O
prescription O
treatment O
if O
this O
winds O
up O
being O
the O
case O
with O
propanolol B-DRUG
. O

I O
know O
heart O
palpitations B-ADR
are O
rarely O
caused O
by O
actual O
cardiac B-ADR
problems I-ADR
, O
so O
I O
try O
not O
to O
freak O
out O
too O
bad O
if O
I O
get O
them O
. O



 O
I O
guess O
I O
was O
n't O
sure O
about O
the O
propanolol B-DRUG
because O
it O
's O
apparently O
to O
* O
prevent O
* O
migraines B-ADR
, O
but O
the O
thing O
is O
mine O
do O
n't O
ever O
stop O
, O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
really O
prevent O
them O
- O
I O
can O
only O
manage O
them O
. O

But O
thank O
you O
for O
sharing O
your O
experience O
! O

I O
'm O
hoping O
any O
side O
effects O
I O
get O
wo O
n't O
too O
awful O
since O
I O
'll O
be O
starting O
out O
on O
a O
small O
dose O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
also O
stupid O
, O
my O
doctor O
prescribed O
Voltaren B-DRUG
, O
not O
Valtrex B-DRUG
. O

That O
makes O
more O
sense O
than O
an O
anti O
- O
viral O
for O
headache B-ADR
management O
. O


I O
quit O
taking O
metformin B-DRUG
because O
of O
this O
. O


Hell O
yeah O
, O
get O
that O
self O
- O
care O
! O

Lexapro B-DRUG
did O
me O
wonders O
, O
but O
keep O
in O
kind O
that O
medications O
affect O
everybody O
differently O
. O



 O
Also O
, O
I O
recommend O
talking O
to O
your O
provider O
about O
propanolol B-DRUG
in O
case O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
SSRI O
makes O
you O
nervous B-ADR
. O

All O
it O
does O
is O
keep O
the O
heart O
from O
pounding O
on O
you O
and O
it O
works O
well O
in O
small O
doses O
. O


You O
do O
nt O
need O
to O
taper O
for O
a O
5 O
day O
course O
of O
any O
dose O

prednisone B-DRUG
. O

Even O
if O
it O
was O
1000 O
mg O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
in O
2014 O
with O
mild O
disease O
, O
stopped O
taking O
Lialda B-DRUG
when O
I O
felt O
better O
and O
then O
horrible O
flare B-ADR
in O
2016 O
, O
was O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
got O
better O
, O
stayed O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
for O
about O
1 O
1/2 O
years O
and O
felt O
better O
so O
I O
stopped O
it O
and O
started O
drinking O
heavily O
, O
started O
flaring B-ADR
again O
in O
March O
of O
2019 O
and O
Remicade B-DRUG
/ O
azathioprine B-DRUG
combo O
had O
me O
better O
for O
a O
bit O
and O
then O
I O
was O
taken O
off O
aza B-DRUG
due O
to O
super O
low O
hemoglobin O
( O
5.4 O
) O
and O
built O
up O
antibodies O
to O
Remicade B-DRUG
so O
it O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
, O
Humira B-DRUG
did O
n't O
work O
for O
me O
so O
I O
started O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
which O
did O
jack O
shit O
for O
me O
. O

Been O
on O
varying O
doses O
of O
Prednisone B-DRUG
since O
August O
2019 O
as O
well O
. O

It O
's O
been O
a O
ride O
. O


I O
go O
in O
for O
a O
regular O
checkup O
and O
suddenly O
the O
nurse O
is O
freaking O
out O
, O
then O
the O
doctor O
, O
and O
they O
bring O
in O
an O
EKG O
machine O
, O
and O
everyone O
keeps O
asking O
me O
, O
" O
Are O
you O
alright O
? O

Are O
you O
in O
any O
pain B-ADR
? O

Do O
you O
feel O
dizzy B-ADR
? O

" O


 O
I O
kept O
telling O
them O
I O
felt O
fine O
. O

I O
guess O
my O
blood O
pressure O
was O
200 O
something O
and O
they O
thought O
I O
was O
having O
a O
stroke B-ADR
or O
heart B-ADR
attack I-ADR
. O



 O
Anyway O
, O
I O
get O
put O
on O
lisinopril B-DRUG
, O
and O
after O
a O
few O
days O
, O
I O
have O
an O
epiphany O
, O
" O
OHHH O
! O

THIS O
is O
what O
normal O
is O
supposed O
to O
feel O
like O
. O

" O


 O
All O
kinds O
of O
stuff O
can O
sneak O
up O
on O
us O
... O
I'm O
all O
about O

care O
now O

In O
my O
experience O
there O
's O
no O
cross O
reaction O

  O
Is O
the O
propanolol B-DRUG
for O
anxiety B-ADR
? O


Try O
Humira B-DRUG

are O
both O

I O
‚Äôm O
in O
the O
process O
of O
switching O
to O
Kesimpta B-DRUG
mainly O
due O
to O
the O
convenience O
- O

I O
was O
going O
to O
switch O

stelara B-DRUG

my O
insurance O
said O
I O

i O

n‚Äôt O

i O
am O
on O
metformin B-DRUG
for O
insulin O

could O
that O
cause O
it O
? O

and O
if O
so O
why O
would O
it O
only O
show O
up O
now O
. O

i O
‚Äôve O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
urinalysis O
this O
last O
month O
and O
it O
only O
showed O
up O
in O
this O
most O
recent O
one O
. O


jesus O
christ O
, O
really O
? O

why O
not O
wrap O
it O
in O
a O

  O
dust O
it O
with O
lipitor B-DRUG

have O
Sammy O

sing O
about O
the O
goddamn O
Candy O
Man O
? O


That O
‚Äôs O
so O
good O
to O
hear O
, O
i O
think O
mi O
JCV O
titers O
are O
high O
now O
but O
i O
‚Äôm O
not O
sure O
if O
they O
are O
really O
high O
. O

Do O
you O
remember O
how O
ofter O
did O
they O
test O
you O
to O
check O
your O
JCV O
status O
while O
on O
tysabri B-DRUG
? O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
really O
have O
fatigue B-ADR
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
so O
hopefully O
i O
will O
be O
fine O
on O
ocrevus B-DRUG
. O

How O
long O
have O
you O
been O
on O
ocrevus B-DRUG
? O

Have O
you O
achieve O
neda O
? O


Most O
pharmacies O
make O
the O
majority O
of O
its O
profit O
off O
cheap O
stuff O
no O
one O
complains O
about O
. O

Lisinopril B-DRUG
, O
phentermine B-DRUG
, O
abx O
, O
statins O
, O
the O
cost O
is O
pennies O
and O
and O
charge O
$ O
10-$30 O
. O

The O
expensive O
stuff O
like O
Eliquis B-DRUG
we O
probably O
make O
less O
profit O
than O
off O
a O
30 O

supply O
of O
zolpidem B-DRUG
. O


My O
left O
hand O
is O
affected O
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
lost O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
feeling O
in O
it O
, O
and O
it O
‚Äôs O
strength O
is O
significantly O
reduced O

But O
this O
is O
now O
. O


In O
a O
previous O
flare B-ADR
up I-ADR
it O
did O
the O
same O
as O
yours O
is O
now O
OP O
. O

The O
steroids O
helped O
a O
lot O
. O

As O
did O
changing O
treatments O
( O
I O
am O
now O
on O
Ocrelizumab B-DRUG
infusions O
twice O
a O
year O
) O
. O

Since O
that O
relapse B-ADR
died O
down O
my O
hand O
works O
again O
but O
I O
do O
have O
reduced O
mobility/ O
dexterity O
compared O
to O
what O
it O
was O
, O
and O
it O
‚Äôs O
still O
reduced O
sensation O
, O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
feel O
hot O
as O
well O
as O
I O
used O
to O
do O
have O
burned O
myself O
a O
few O
times O
, O
and O
also O
shut O
my O
hand O
in O
a O
van O
door O
( O
although O
that O
time O
I O
was O
quite O
grateful O
for O
the O
reduced O
sensation O
because O
I O
felt O
that O
and O
it O
hurt O
, O
I O
dread O
to O
think O
what O
it O
would O
have O
been O
like O
if O
I O
could O
feel O
things O
properly O
) O

How O
long O
has O
your O

going O
on O

Are O

Sending O
hugs O
. O


I O
‚Äôve O
only O
taken O
Zoloft B-DRUG
, O
would O
not O
recommend O
. O

I O
became O
a O
literal O
zombie O
which O
made O
me O
feel O
even O
worse O

I O
wert O
straight O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Then O
Stelara B-DRUG
and O
Taltz B-DRUG
. O

Taltz B-DRUG
finally O
worked O
. O


I O
take O
Benadryl B-DRUG
and O
use O
an O
albuterol B-DRUG
inhaler O
. O

I O
also O
have O
a O
nebulizer O
to O
use O
if O
my O
breathing O
is O
really O
bad O
. O

It O
's O
helpful O
when O
I O
'm O
coughing B-ADR
too O
much O
for O
the O
inhaler O
. O

My O
allergist O
prescribed O
prednisone B-DRUG
to O
keep O
on O
hand O
. O

I O
take O
that O
if O
the O
reaction B-ADR
is O
still O
progressing O
45 O
min O
after O
100 O
mg O
Benadryl B-DRUG
. O

I O
also O
have O
epi O
pens O

 O
For O
a O
gastrointestinal B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
, O
I O
'll O
take O
Imodium B-DRUG

it O
does O
n't O
stop O
after O
3 O
bathroom O
trips O

 O
There O
are O
Facebook O
groups O
for O
MCAS O
that O
have O
doctor O
lists O
, O
it O
's O
a O
good O
way O
to O
give O
a O
doctor O
who O
can O
help O
, O
if O
you O
need O
one O
. O

Also O
, O
saw O
that O
you O
said O
your O
doctor O
thinks O
depression B-ADR
may O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
your O
symptoms O
. O

Antidepressants O
can O
make O
MCAS O
worse O
for O
some O
people O
, O
because O
anything O
that O
affects O
your O
serotonin O
levels O
can O
cause O
GI O
symptoms O
. O

That O
does O
n't O
mean O
you O
should O
n't O
take O
them O
, O
just O
watch O
out O
for O
it O
making O
symptoms O
worse O
. O


If O
it O
's O
at O
all O
helpful O
, O
I O
take O
sertraline B-DRUG
, O
though O
I O
'm O
pretty O
sure O
it O
's O
also O
an O
antidepressant O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
that O
's O
applicable O
for O
you O
, O
but O
it O
would O
n't O
hurt O
to O
ask O
. O



 O
In O
the O

I O
suggest O
confidence O

building O

‚Ä¶ O

INSIDE O

I O
was O
suicidal B-ADR
AF O
‚Ä¶ O
I O
had O
to O
get O

And O
that O
was O
on O

huge O

on O
my O

under O
my O

 O
‚Ä¶ O
Once O
I O
finally O
started O
it O
, O
about O
6 O
months O

, O
I O
have O
n‚Äôt O
had O
so O
much O
as O
had O
a O

I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O

I O
take O
vitamins O

I O
got O
COVID O
twice O
( O

and O
had O
no O

after O
3 O

one O

there O

 O

Most O
SSRIs O
have O
a O
half O
life O

about O
one O
day O
. O

Fluoxetine B-DRUG
is O
a O
huge O
exception O
, O
you O
're O
right O
. O

I O
should O
've O
stated O
that O
cycling O
off O
my O
medication O
is O
something O
that O
I O
do O
as O
I O
am O
used O
to O
the O
effects O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
entirely O
without O
risk O
. O


They O
make O
flavored O
pills O
for O
cats O
. O

If O
your O
vet O
does O
n‚Äôt O
have O
them O
, O
call O
around O
, O
you O
‚Äôre O
bound O
to O
find O
a O
vet O
with O
cat O
- O
friendly O
flavors O
. O



 O
My O
cat O
who O
could O
really O
put O
up O
a O
fight O
if O
she O
did O
n‚Äôt O
want O
a O
pill O
would O
happily O
take O
chicken O
liver O
flavored O
prednisone B-DRUG
. O


So O
, O
I O
felt O
better O
the O
day O
I O
started O
it O
, O
but O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
why O
. O

I O
was O
so O
unable O
to O
cope O
that O
I O
had O
to O
take O
leave O
from O
work O
and O
move O
in O
with O
my O
mom O
for O
a O
while O
. O

I O
think O
just O
taking O
the O
pressure O
off O
and O
knowing O
I O
was O
somewhere O
safe O
and O
that O
help O
( O
Sertraline B-DRUG
) O
was O
on O
the O
way O
helped O
. O

The O
road O
to O
feeling O
better O
has O
been O
very O
cyclical O
for O
me O
. O

So O
the O
good O
news O
was O
that O
I O
got O
a O
respite O
that O
first O
month O
, O
and O
the O
lows O
were O
nowhere O
near O
as O
low O
as O
they O
had O
been O
, O
but O
it O
may O
be O
up O
and O
down O
for O
a O
few O
months O
yet O
. O

Feel O
free O
to O
PM O
me O
if O
you O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
touch O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
had O
had O
someone O
with O
PMDD B-ADR
to O
assure O
me O
that O
even O
when O
the O
lows O
come O
, O
they O
will O
absolutely O
not O
last O
. O

Edit O
to O
add O
: O
take O
the O
benzos B-DRUG
if O
you O
need O
them O
. O

I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
take O
one O
until O
last O
month O
and O
my O
god O
I O
felt O
normal O
finally O
. O

Obviously O
do O
n‚Äôt O
overuse O
them O
as O
they O
can O
cause O
rebound O
anxiety B-ADR
, O
but O
if O
you O
‚Äôre O
spiralling O
, O
do O
n‚Äôt O
be O
afraid O
to O
take O
one O
. O


Propanolol B-DRUG
can O
have O
mental O
effects O
since O
it O
crosses O
the O
blood O
brain O
barrier O
. O

Worth O
trying O
if O
your O
doc O
gives O
ok O
because O
it O
's O
cheap O
and O
simple O
and O
safe O
. O

If O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
no O
sweat O
. O



 O
There O
's O
some O
supporting O
research O
that O
it O
can O
help O
PTSD O
since O
it O
changes O
how O
adrenaline O
fueled O
memories O
are O
accessed O
and O
stored O
. O


Kesimpta B-DRUG
was O
n‚Äôt O
available O
when O
I O
started O
my O
DMT O
and O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
since O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
in O
2019 O
. O

So O
far O
it O
‚Äôs O
been O
great O
, O
no O
progression O
since O
my O
first O
MRI O
and O
I O
generally O
feel O
pretty O
good O
. O

I O
have O
no O
plans O
to O
switch O
to O
Kesimpta B-DRUG
, O
partially O
because O
I O
like O
only O
needing O
to O
worry O
about O
my O
treatment O
twice O
a O
year O
but O
mostly O
because O
I O
know O
I O
would O
never O
be O
able O
to O
self O
inject O
. O


It O
just O
seems O
to O
be O
that O
given O
the O
tech O
available O
to O
the O
world O
it O
would O
n‚Äôt O
be O
that O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
Lipitor B-DRUG
from O
the O
pharmacy O
to O
the O
floor O
. O


I O
just O
finish O
weening O
off O
250 O
mg O
effexor B-DRUG
with O
20 O
mg O
prozac B-DRUG
as O
a O
‚Äú O
buffer O
‚Äù O
. O

The O
withdrawls B-ADR
were O
fucked O
and O
i O
also O
thought O
i O
would O
lose O
my O
job O
. O

I O
know O
te O
withdrawls B-ADR
would O
of O
been O
worse O
without O
the O
prozac B-DRUG
though O
as O
i O
have O
tried O
before O
. O

Honestly O
just O
stick O
through O
it O
and O
once O
you O
‚Äôre O
off O
u O
feel O
so O
clear O
headed O
. O

I O
was O
very O
open O
to O
my O
work O
about O
what O
i O
was O
going O
through O
and O
even O
comparing O
it O
to O
heroin O
withdrawls O
to O
make O
people O
understand O
( O
I O
‚Äôm O
sure O
they O
‚Äôve O
seen O
heroin O
withdrawls O
in O
movies O
hence O
why O
i O
used O
that O
for O
context O
) O

I O
got O
them O
bad O
for O
like O
2 O
months O
after O
stopping O
Zoloft B-DRUG
granted O
I O
did O
it O
cold O
turkey O
so O
it O
was O
just O
a O
symptom O
of O
withdrawal B-ADR

We O

have O
separate O

for O
certain O
people O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
the O
highest O
point O
in O
our O
history O
. O


Oooo O
I O
had O
to O
take O
an O
oral O
medication O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
cause O
it O
was O
n‚Äôt O
strong O
enough O
! O

Definitely O
reach O
out O
and O
ask O
! O

ALWAYS O
voice O
your O
concerns O

After O
I O
got O
additional O
medicine O
, O
my O
stool O

has O
gotten O
better O

Genentech O
( O
who O
makes O
Ocrevus B-DRUG

has O
not O
come O
out O
with O
any O
studies O
about O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
and O
pregnancy O
. O

However O
, O
they O
do O
have O
a O
pregnancy O
registry O
for O
those O
who O
get O
accidentally O
pregnant O
while O
on O
the O
medication O

I O
am O
one O
of O
those O
women O
and O
so O
far O
so O
good O
, O
although O
baby O
is O
n‚Äôt O
born O
yet O
. O

I O
stopped O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
once O
I O
found O
out O
I O
was O
pregnant O
, O
but O
my O
neurologist O
and O
maternal O
fetal O
medicine O
specialist O
and O
the O
baby O
‚Äôs O
future O
pediatrician O
had O
no O
concerns O
about O
it O
. O



 O
It O
‚Äôs O
all O
anecdotal O
at O
this O
point O
, O
but O
my O
neurologist O
did O
used O
to O
work O
in O
a O
community O
where O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
was O
not O
used O
and O
many O
of O
her O
patients O
would O
get O
pregnant O
while O
on O
treatment O
with O
no O
effects O
. O


To O
be O
honest O
, O
metformin B-DRUG
has O
never O
helped O
me O
lose B-ADR
weight I-ADR
. O

  O
It O
just O
did O
n‚Äôt O
work O
that O
way O
for O
me O
. O

Following O
a O
strict O
low O
carb O
, O
limited O
sugar O
, O
no O
dairy O
and O
no O
gluten O
diet O
is O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
has O
helped O
me O
lose B-ADR
weight I-ADR
. O


I O
had O
covid O
while O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
, O
and O
was O
completely O
asymptomatic O
. O

  O
I O
have O
three O
Pfizer O
boosters O
that O
were O
done O
before O
starting O
it O
. O

  O
Doc O
did O
n‚Äôt O
prescribe O
Paxlovid B-DRUG
since O
I O
was O
doing O
so O
well O
. O

  O
I O
‚Äôm O
three O
infusions O
in O
and O
no O
other O
Illness O
so O
far O
. O


Oh O
this O
makes O
so O
much O
sense O
! O

Psoriasis B-ADR
at O
9ish O
, O
severe O
. O

Covered O
75 O
% O
of O
my O
body O
all O
the O
time O
. O

It O
never O
came O
and O
went O
. O

This O
is O
also O
when O
Hidradenitis B-ADR
Suppurative I-ADR
began O
, O
but O
went O
undiagnosed O
until O
inwas O
like O
28 O
. O

Fast O
forward O
to O
33 O
, O
get O
diagnosed O
with O
psoriatic B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
and O
regular O
arthritis B-ADR
to O
the O
point O
where O
my O
knees O
both O
need O
replacing O
. O

I O
also O
have O
raging O
gout B-ADR
. O

I O
'm O
currently O
being O
tested O
for O
others O
but O
not O
sure O
where O
it O
'll O
fall O
. O

I O
'm O
38 O
. O

For O
years O
doctors O
laughed O
at O
me O
because O
I O
was O
too O
young O
for O
the O
symptoms O
I O
was O
having O
. O

I O
  O
take O
methotrexate B-DRUG
( O
a O
low O
dose O
chemotherapy O
drug O
) O
and O
humira B-DRUG
weekly O
now O
. O

Thankfully O
my O
psoriasis B-ADR
is O
all O
but O
gone O
, O
controlled O
by O
the O
meds O
and O
any O
lapse O
in O
doses O
causes O
it O
to O
immedietly O
start O
to O
come O
back O
. O

The O
rest O
remains O
. O



 O
And O
that O
does O
n't O
touch O
the O
mental O
side O
of O
things O
. O



 O
Now O
I O
have O
some O
research O
to O
do O
... O

I O
started O
off O
on O
Zoloft B-DRUG
to O
manage O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
and O
later O
had O
Wellbutrin B-DRUG
added O
in O
for O
the O
depression B-ADR
. O

The O
combination O
works O
great O
for O
me O
. O


I O
had O
this O
same O
idea O
of O
doing O
the O
PCT O
or O
the O
AT O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
on O
any O
infusion O
because O
I O
stopped O
doing O
them O
. O

Cost O
of O
Co O
- O
pay O
was O
getting O
unaffordable O
. O

I O
only O
have O
daily O
meds O
currently O
. O

  O
I O
was O
thinking O
of O
doing O
Humira B-DRUG
because O
its O
cheaper O
. O

I O
was O
thinking O
it O
's O
Possible O
to O
get O
the O
doctor O
to O
send O
in O
prescription O
to O
pharmacies O
along O
the O
way O
. O

I O
like O
3month O
supply O
deal O
so O
it O
saves O
money O
( O
you O
'd O
have O
to O
carry O
all O
3 O
bottles O
tho O
. O

You O
can O
do O
your O
resupply O
. O

Have O
a O
friend O
/ O
family O
send O
the O
meds O
to O
you O
. O

But O
for O
infusion O
it O
would O
be O
difficult O
  O
unless O
you O
can O
afford O
to O
fly O
home O
for O
treatments O
. O

Being O
on O
Medicaid O
that O
wo O
n't O
work O
unless O
you O
have O
a O
support O
system O
that O
is O
will O
to O
pay O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
being O
easily O
accessible O
might O
be O
your O
answer O
. O

  O
Do O
your O
town O
/ O
resupply O
near O
where O
you O
'd O
pick O
up O
your O
meds O
. O

  O
It O
can O
work O
. O

See O
I O
've O
been O
thinking O
too O
. O

Just O
because O
we O
have O
an O
illness B-ADR
does O
n't O
mean O
we O
have O
live O
life O
in O
the O
bathroom O
. O

lol O
. O


Remicade B-DRUG
and O
Humira B-DRUG
are O
both O
TNF O
- O
alpha O
inhibitors O
, O
so O
it O
makes O
sense O
that O
if O
you O
're O
experiencing O
drug O
- O
induced O
lupus B-ADR
from O
one O
, O
that O
you O
could O
continue O
to O
experience O
it O
from O
the O
other O
. O



 O
Hopefully O
switching O
to O
Stelara B-DRUG
will O
help O
( O
after O
you O
fail O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
of O
course O
lmao O
) O
! O


Yeah O
that O
‚Äôs O
just O
cause O
your O
tolerance B-ADR
is O
bad O
and O
you O
had O
too O
much O
, O
you O
sound O
alot O
like O
me O
benzo B-DRUG
are O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
work O
, O
have O
you O
tried O
propanolol B-DRUG
and O
adderall B-DRUG

As O
soon O
as O
Tysabri B-DRUG
was O
released O
again O
my O
husband O
took O
it O
for O
12 O
years O
. O

He O
finally O
tested O
too O
high O
on O
JC O
titres O
. O

It O
was O
working O
so O
well O
. O

Ocrevus B-DRUG
is O
currently O
working O
. O

He O
would O
sign O
anything O
to O
get O
back O
on O
Tysabri B-DRUG
. O


I O
‚Äôm O
not O
a O
doctor O
or O
an O
expert O
on O
bp O
med O
and O
alcohol O
interactions O
so O
take O
my O
opinion O
with O
a O
boulder O
of O
salt O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
on O
20 O
mg O
lisinopril B-DRUG
and O
I O
‚Äôve O
had O
a O
few O
drinks(like O
3 O
shots O
2 O
beers O
) O
maybe O
3 O
times O
since O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
my O
medication O
and O
felt O
completely O
normal O
. O

Again O
I O
would O
run O
it O
by O
your O
doctor O
first O
. O


I O
recently O
had O
my O
first O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
. O

No O
issues O
really O
but O
found O
it O
hard O
to O
sleep O
the O
first O
2 O
night O
after O
the O
infusion O
. O

I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
into O
a O
clinical O
trial O
for O
it O
so O
zero O
cost O
. O

The O
nurse O
told O
me O
that O
typically O
if O
you O
do O
n‚Äôt O
have O
issues O
with O
the O
first O
full O
dose O
you O
wo O
n‚Äôt O
have O
a O
problem O
later O
. O


There O
ARE O
risks O
with O
ivermectin B-DRUG
. O

And O
no O

regardless O
of O
what O

i O
said O
, O
there O
* O
are O

potential O

but O
I O
took O
Humira B-DRUG
years O
ago O
for O
a O
separate O
issue O
, O
which O
is O
called O
a O
" O

the O

As O
we O
know O

everything O

 O
Keto O

would O

 O
The O

its O

together O
and O
let O
‚Äôs O
you O
go O
on O

. O

Yeah O
metformin B-DRUG
has O
been O
an O
absolute O
game O
changer O
for O
me O
so O
definitely O
ask O
about O
it O
coz O
the O
weight B-ADR
gain I-ADR
on O
olanzapine B-DRUG
can O
be O
crazy O
, O
it O
was O
for O
me O
before O
metformin B-DRUG
. O

Aw O
man O
I O
went O
undiagnosed O
for O
6 O
years O
before O
i O
finally O
finally O
got O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
bipolar O
1 O
which O
I O
already O
knew O
I O
had O
because O
it O
was O
so O
god O
damn O
obvious O
. O

So O
that O
involved O
me O
ruining O
my O
life O
many O
many O
times O
and O
it O
was O
absolute O
hell O
. O

The O
past O
4 O
years O
it O
‚Äôs O
been O
way O
better O
due O
to O
meds O
but O
we O
have O
n‚Äôt O
got O
it O
perfect O
yet O
. O

I O
‚Äôll O
take O
this O
over O
being O

for O
the O
physical O

anxiety B-ADR
you O
could O
try O
propanolol B-DRUG

hydroxyzine B-DRUG

I O
had O
to O
get O
bloodwork O
every O
3 O

so O
you O
'll O

I O
've O
been O

3 O

rituxan B-DRUG
before O

( O

the O

for O
almost O

No O

It O
's O
not O
really O
a O
good O
place O
for O
me O
to O
try O
to O
distinguish O
seizure B-ADR
from O

( O
the O
former O
is O
a O
brain B-ADR

, O
the O
latter O
is O
really O
just O
fainting B-ADR
from O
poor O
heart O

) O
for O
your O
pet O
. O

You O
need O
your O
vet O
to O
do O
that O
. O

But O
it O
really O
makes O
a O
difference O
in O
treatment O
. O

There O
is O
a O
blood O
test O
that O
can O
help O
with O
heart B-ADR
disease I-ADR
( O
proBNP O

, O
but O
your O

has O
probably O
passed O

and O
just O
needs O
chest B-ADR
X O

an O

It O
's O
good O
that O
the O

It O
's O
normal O
that O
you O
would O
n't O
have O
the O

it O
's O
really O
helpful O
to O
get O
a O

when O
you O
need O
a O
second O

- O
even O
on O

You O
want O
a O

ocrevus B-DRUG

Do O
you O
know O
if O
that O
lowers O
my O
chances O
of O
achieving O
NEDA O
? O

or O
where O
can O
i O
read O
more O
about O
it O
. O

I O
remember O
reading O
an O
article O
about O
this O
buy O
I O
ca O
n‚Äôt O
find O
it O

If O
this O
is O
a O
serious O
issue O
that O
you O
can O
not O
get O
past O
, O
you O
can O
talk O
to O
a O
doctor O
about O
propanolol B-DRUG
. O

It O
's O
not O
addictive B-ADR
and O
only O
used O
when O
needed O
. O



 O
It O
is O
very O
common O
with O
surgeons O
and O
public O
speakers O
, O
being O
a O
beta O
blocker O
it O
stops O
the O
physical O
aspects O
of O
stage O
fright O
without O
going O
as O
far O
as O
a O
benzodiazepine B-DRUG
or O
alcohol O
. O


PMDD B-ADR
here O
and O
do O
n‚Äôt O
have O
a O
CPTSD O
diagnosis O
but O
I O
definitely O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
symptoms O
. O

Yes O
, O
Zoloft B-DRUG
is O
working O
for O
me O
. O

It O
takes O
time O
to O
build O
up O
in O
your O
system O
and O
for O
me O
I O
still O
fluctuate O
with O
my O
cycle O
but O
( O
fingers O
crossed O
, O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
it O
for O
8 O
months O
, O
this O
dose O
for O
1 O
month O
) O
overall O
I O
‚Äôm O
generally O
able O
to O
handle O
the O
PMDD B-ADR
symptoms O
with O
tools O
from O
therapy O
, O
whereas O
a O
year O
ago O
I O
was O
at O
the O
mercy O
of O
it O

Not O
saying O
it O
is O
drug O
induced O
lupus B-ADR
but O
I O
also O
got O
diagnosed O
with O
it O
when O
I O
was O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
. O

When O
my O
GI O
decided O
to O
switch O
me O
to O
a O
new O
biologic O
, O
he O
said O
that O
we O
are O
n‚Äôt O
even O
going O
to O
try O
Humira B-DRUG
because O
it O
‚Äôs O
too O
similar O
to O
Remicade B-DRUG
and O
more O
than O
likely O
, O
I O
would O
generate O
the O
same O
response O
aka O
drug O
induced O
lupus B-ADR
. O

So O
it O
‚Äôs O
possible O
. O

But O
it O
would O
never O
hurt O
to O
get O
a O
second O
opinion O
. O


I O
recently O
went O
from O
taking O
it O
every O
other O
week O
to O
taking O
it O
every O
10 O
days O
. O

My O
doctor O
said O
that O
if O
I O
had O
any O
trouble O
with O
insurance O
, O
I O
should O
reach O
out O
to O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
ambassado4 O
since O
they O
do O
give O
people O
assistance O
through O
discounts O
and O
rebates O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
not O
having O
to O
do O
that O
because O
my O
insurance O
has O
been O
covering O
it O
so O
far O
. O

Have O
you O
reached O
out O
to O
AbbVie O
yet O
? O


I O
had O
an O
echo O
and O
then O
I O
‚Äôll O
sent O
for O
an O
MRI O
with O
contrast O
dye O
, O
I O
am O
on O
a O
ton O
of O
medication O
: O

Ramipril B-DRUG
, O
Bisoprolol B-DRUG
, O
Eplerenone B-DRUG
, O
Ivabradine B-DRUG
and O
I O
have O
just O
started O
on O
Empagliflozin B-DRUG
‚Ä¶ O
I O
was O
on O
Furosemide B-DRUG
but O
I O
‚Äôm O
off O
that O
now O

Metformin B-DRUG
had O
taken O
care O
of O
that O
for O
me O
for O
2 O
decades O
lol O
. O

Minimum O
2 O
poops O
here O
a O
day O
. O


Atorvastatin B-DRUG
is O
on O
the O
formulary O
at O
the O
hospital O
where O
I O
trained O
and O
at O
the O
hospital O
I O
currently O
admit O
to O
. O

Other O
stations O
are O
not O
. O

When O
I O
was O
in O
training O
, O
I O
hated O
having O
to O
always O
convert O
back O
and O
forth O
so O
I O
ended O
up O
initiating O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
instead O
. O



 O
Now O
I O
find O
rosuvastatin B-DRUG
is O
better O
tolerated O
, O
especially O
at O
higher O
doses O
. O

So O
I O
often O
convert O
people O
to O
rosuvastatin B-DRUG
40 O
mg O
instead O
of O
increasing O
the O
dose O
of O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
to O
80 O
mg O
. O


In O
addition O
to O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
I O
take O
a O
handful O
of O
pills O
morning O
and O
night O
and O
several O
vitamin O
supplements O
every O
day O
. O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
think O
of O
it O
too O
often O
but O
when O
I O
do O
I O
wonder O
how O
much O
‚Äú O
me O
‚Äù O
there O
is O
with O
all O
that O
running O
through O
my O
bloodstream O
, O
and O
sometimes O
I O
wonder O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
some O
kind O
of O
crisis O
made O
any O
of O
it O
unavailable O
. O

I O
usually O
try O
to O
refill O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
so O
I O
can O
get O
a O
little O
buffer O
stored O
up O
because O
some O
of O
my O
prescriptions O
require O
tapering O
off O
to O
avoid O
bad O
side O
effects O
, O
so O
I O
want O
to O
have O
enough O
on O
hand O
to O
do O
that O
if O
it O
came O
to O
that O
. O


Still O
on O
100 O
mg O
Prozac B-DRUG
, O
a O
few O
other O
natural O
supplements O
( O
L O
- O
theanine O
, O
high O
EPA O
omega-3 O
fish O
oil O
, O
multivitamin O
) O
. O

Those O
combined O
with O
fairly O
regular O
exercise O
and O
some O
not O
too O
crazy O
dietary O
changes O
, O
and O
I O
‚Äôm O
doing O
better O
than O
I O
have O
in O
over O
20 O
years O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
totally O
ok O
with O
being O
on O
100 O
mg O
for O
the O
next O
50 O
years O
if O
need O
be O

Have O
you O
checked O
the O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
website O
? O


Well O
, O
hey O
now O
. O

Let O
‚Äôs O
not O
get O
ahead O
of O
ourselves O
. O



 O
It O
‚Äôs O
always O
a O
good O
time O
when O
my O
pharmacist O
water O
boards O
me O
and O
makes O
me O
beg O
for O
my O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
. O



 O
Do O
n‚Äôt O
punish O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
! O



 O
( O
I O
pray O
this O
is O
n‚Äôt O
needed O
but O
‚Äú O
/s O
‚Äù O
) O

I O
always O
get O
sinus B-ADR
infections I-ADR
or O
bronchitis B-ADR
with O
the O
change O
of O
season O
summer O
to O
fall O
and O
fall O
to O
winter O
. O

I O
work O
in O
a O
large O
medical O
office O
that O
easily O
sees O
200 O
patient O
's O
a O
day O
. O

With O
that O
said O
I O
started O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
last O
July O
and O
actually O
did O
n't O
get O
sick B-ADR
like O
I O
usually O
do O
. O

I O
did O
get O
a O
sinus B-ADR
infection I-ADR
but O
it O
was O
no O
worse O
than O
it O
normally O
is O
. O

I O
dodged O
it O
for O
3 O
years O
but O
I O
did O
get O
covid O
the O
beginning O
of O
May O
. O

I O
had O
a O
wicked O
cough B-ADR
, O
body O
aches B-ADR
and O
fatigue B-ADR
it O
was O
n't O
horrible O
. O

I O
did O
get O
antivirals O
and O
antibodies O
which O
I O
think O
helped O
the O
symptoms O
from O
getting O
worse O
. O



 O
I O
did O
modify O
my O
life O
from O
starting O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
to O
about O
December O
. O

I O
kept O
my O
exposure O
bubble O
small O
and O
avoided O
large O
gatherings O
especially O
if O
there O
were O
kids O
. O

I O
ve O
relaxed O
since O
then O
and O
when O
the O
mask O
mandate O
in O
my O
state O
was O
lifted O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
wear O
one O
at O
work O
or O
when O
I O
shop O
. O

If O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
be O
in O
a O
large O
group O
of O
people O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
I O
wear O
a O
mask O
. O

My O
neurologist O
said O
that O
she O
did O
n't O
tell O
people O
to O
avoid O
gatherings O
and O
parties O
precovid O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
wipe O
your O
whole O
immune O
system O
if O
you O
were O
healthy O
before O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
would O
have O
a O
problem O
. O

I O
was O
not O
healthy O
before O
I O
always O
got O
sick B-ADR
and O
in O
a O
way O
feel O
like O
the O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
has O
helped O
me O
not O
get O
sick B-ADR
as O
much O
. O

I O
felt O
the O
same O
way O
last O
year O
that O
I O
had O
to O
stay O
home O
in O
a O
bubble O
and O
I O
did O
for O
a O
bit O
but O
realized O
it O
just O
was O
n't O
viable O
. O

I O
am O
extra O
careful O
the O
weeks O
before O
my O
infusion O
and O
the O
weeks O
after O
but O
that O
's O
about O
it O
. O



 O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
on O
a O
crazy O
roller O
coaster O
of O
emotions O
when O
I O
was O
first O
diagnosed O
. O

It O
was O
a O
whirlwind O
of O
appointments O
, O
mris O
and O
choosing O
a O
DMT O
. O

My O
Dr O
said O
to O
give O
it O
6 O
months O
and O
things O
will O
level O
off O
. O

I O
told O
her O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
patient O
Patient O
but O
she O
was O
right O
. O

By O
January O
things O
settled O
and O
I O
was O
adapting O
to O
life O
with O
MS O

Honestly O
I O
‚Äôve O
seen O
NP O
‚Äôs O
who O
‚Äôve O
been O
practicing O
in O
a O
field O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
are O
incredibly O
knowledgable O
, O
sometimes O
even O
more O
so O
than O
board O
certified O
clinical O
pharmacists O
that O
I O
knew O
( O
who O
were O
definitely O
competent O
) O
. O

So O
like O
, O
mad O
respect O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
mid O
level O
practitioners O
I O
work O
with O
at O
my O
hospital O
are O
an O
APN O
and O
a O
few O
PA O
‚Äôs O
and O
they O
‚Äôre O
all O
fantastic O
. O



 O
The O
only O
thing O
I O
will O
say O
is O
sometimes O
there O
‚Äôs O
certain O
things O
that O
are O
corner O
cases O
that O
I O
‚Äôve O
seen O
NP O
‚Äôs O
who O
are O
less O
experienced O
wo O
n‚Äôt O
notice O
that O
can O
lead O
to O
problems O
. O

Like O
, O
someone O
reordered O
gemfibrozil B-DRUG
and O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
80 O
( O
highest O
dose O
of O
Lipitor B-DRUG
) O
, O
and O
the O
patient O
was O
admitted O
for O
rhabdomyolysis B-ADR
. O

Gemfibrozil B-DRUG
and O
most O
statins O
, O
but O
especially O
Lipitor B-DRUG
, O
are O
contraindicated O
together O
because O
if O
given O
together O
they O
have O
an O
extremely O
high O
risk O
of O
rhabdomyolysis B-ADR
( O
usually O
you O
just O
should O
use O
Fenofibrate B-DRUG
instead O
of O
gemfibrozil B-DRUG
, O
which O
has O
a O
much O
lower O
risk O
of O
rhabdo O
) O


 O
But O
, O
honestly O
like O
, O
you O
have O
to O
start O
learning O
somewhere O
and O
those O
things O
are O
all O
part O
of O
the O
growing O
process O
. O

And O
also O
, O
NP O
‚Äôs O
and O
PA O
‚Äôs O
know O
wayyyy O
more O
than O
me O
about O
a O
ton O
of O
other O
things O
, O
namely O
diagnosis O
. O

So O
everyone O
has O
different O
strengths O
. O


There O
are O
many O
roads O
to O
try O
: O


 O
* O
Diet O
: O
You O
can O
go O
down O
this O
long O
road O
of O
elimination O
to O
see O
if O
anything O
helps O
. O

Gluten O

nightshade O
vegetables O

Topicals O
: O
Not O
a O

worked O
for O
me O

but O
there O
are O
MANY O
. O


* O
Biologics O
: O
Injectable O
drugs O
that O
also O
compromise O
your O

never O

myself O
right O
up O
and O
then O
got O
caught O
in O
a O
prescription O
cost O
nightmare O
and O
decided O
that O
rent O
and O
food O
was O
probably O
more O
important O
than O
my O
skin O
. O

I O
'm O
American O
, O
so O
it O
may O
be O
different O
for O
you O
depending O
on O
your O
location O
. O



 O
Also O
, O
you O
have O
lots O
of O
scaling O
. O

There O
are O
some O
good O
products O
that O
help O
keep O
it O
moisturized O
and O
soaps O
make O
a O
difference O
. O

I O
think O
there O
are O
some O
great O
resources O
pinned O
on O
here O
. O


I O
can O
only O
take O
Metformin B-DRUG
at O
night O
or O
I O
have O
GI B-ADR
issue I-ADR

As O
soon O
as O
my O
dog O
gets O
his O
Prozac B-DRUG
covered O
under O
my O
health O
plan O
, O
then O
he O
‚Äôs O
my O
child O
! O


I O
'm O
making O
the O
assumption O
you O
are O
American O
and O
I O
find O
it O
really O
interesting O
seeing O
some O
comparisons O
. O

In O
my O
province O
, O
vaccines O
are O
the O
territory O
of O
public O
health O
. O

A O
doctor O
does O
n't O
decide O
what O
you O
get O
, O
public O
health O
guidelines O
do O
. O

Before O
I O
started O
MTX O
and O
humira B-DRUG
for O
arthritis B-ADR
years O
ago O
, O
I O
was O
doing O
all O
the O
vax O
updating O
. O

Public O
health O
straight O
up O
said O
" O

might O
as O
well O
get O
the O
shingles B-ADR
vax O
while O
we O
are O

" O

Can O
I O
ask O
when O
you O
take O
the O
Zoloft B-DRUG
, O
together O
with O
the O
Wellbutrin B-DRUG
or O
later O
in O
the O
day O
? O

Do O
you O
find O
that O
the O
Wellbutrin B-DRUG
keeps O
the O
Zoloft B-DRUG
side O
effects O
of O
weight B-ADR
gain I-ADR
/ O
low B-ADR
libido I-ADR
at O

? O


I O
‚Äôm O
not O

. O

I O
got O
the O
hmmm O
maybe O
you O
do O
have O
dysautonomia B-ADR
. O

Anyway O
, O
I O
took O
one O
dose O
of O
lisinopril B-DRUG
and O
I O
ca O
n‚Äôt O
tolerate O
how O
intense O
the O
side O
effects O
are O
. O

  O
I O
can O
never O
get O
anybody O
to O
believe O
me O
that O
if O
it O
has O
an O
unpleasant O
side O
effect O
, O
I O
‚Äôm O
going O
to O
experience O
it O
. O



 O
I O
‚Äôm O
sorry O
you O
are O
having O
a O
hard O
time O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
find O
stuff O
that O
helps O
. O


I O
am O
so O
sorry O
for O
your O
losses O
. O


What O
you O
are O
saying O
about O
the O
other O
auto O
- O
immune O
diseases O
possibility O
makes O
a O
lot O
of O
sense O
to O
me O
. O


I O
have O
Beh√ßet O
's O
, O
Hashimoto O
's O
thyroiditis B-ADR
and O
MS O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
the O
doctors O
asked O
me O
when O
the O
Beh√ßet O
's O
was O
diagnosed O
was O
" O
are O
you O
planning O
to O
have O
another O
kid O
? O

" O
because O
of O
the O
consequences O
for O
the O
fetus O
whilst O
I O
was O
taking O
Adalimumab B-DRUG
. O

My O
MS O
then O
appeared O
in O
force O
( O
I O
had O
the O
first O
flare B-ADR
up I-ADR
15 O
years O
ago O
but O
nothing O
was O
done O
) O
and O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
the O
Adalimumab B-DRUG
and O
I O
am O
now O
on O
Rituximab B-DRUG
, O
which O
is O
not O
working O
for O
the O
Beh√ßet O
's O
at O
least O
. O

But O
, O
again O
, O
I O
was O
asked O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
pregnant O
before O
starting O
on O
Rituximab B-DRUG
. O


But O
, O
as O
a O
specialist O
nurse O
, O
I O
totally O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
about O
other O
disease O
possibilities O
and/or O
the O
drugs O
not O
being O
safe O
for O
a O
possible O
pregnancy O
. O

I O
believe O
they O
are O
not O
safe O
. O


Again O
, O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
for O
what O
you O
are O
going O
through O
. O


Btw O
, O
I O
am O
in O
Portugal O
, O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
is O
not O
considered O
safe O
in O
pregnancy O
. O

I O
read O
it O
somewhere O
, O
and O
if O
I O
find O
it O
I O
will O
send O
it O
to O
you O

the O

Bonus O

noticed O

names O
end O
in O
" O
-ib O
" O
or O
" O

biologics O

Those O
drugs O
are O
most O
effective O

may O
also O
be O

That O

what O

I O

you O
mentioned O
taking O
some O
i O
m O
guessing O
by O

the O
shot O
is O
extremely O
effective O

It O

been O
3 O

I O

My O

Men O
hit O

they O
could O
tell O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
it O

Honestly O
I O
just O
wish O
people O
assumed O
that O
I O
've O
tried O
everything O
on O
my O

that O
it O
really O
is O
a O
bunch O

stuff O
out O

is O
making O
me O
miserable O

that O

I O
take O

costs O

Obviously O
, O
no O

can O
pay O
that O
much O

especially O
forever O

I O
'll O
be O

at O

30 O

 O
I O
got O
connected O
with O
this O

decrease O
costs O

only O
pay O

Do O
you O
burp O
even O
after O

even O
flat O
water O
? O

It O
started O
2 O
weeks O

for O

I O
had O
done O
about O
3 O
weeks O

intermittent O
fasting O

with O
a O
few O
24 O
hour O

During O
that O
time O
I O
was O
taking O
25 O
mg O
of O
Zoloft B-DRUG
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
after O
not O
eating O
for O
hours O
‚Ä¶ O
could O
that O
have O
caused O
gastritis B-ADR
? O


hey O
, O
  O
I O
know O
you O
're O
a O
pharmacist O
, O
so O
could O
I O
get O
your O
opinion O
on O
something O
? O



 O
I O
restarted O
the O
yaz B-DRUG
, O
and O
with O
the O
higher O
dose O
of O
metformin B-DRUG
I O
'm O
on O
( O
1000 O
mg O
XR O
) O
, O
I O
have O
literally O
felt O
like O
I O
'm O
on O
speed O
or O
something O
. O

Is O
there O
a O
reason O
for O
this O
? O



 O
I O
posted O
more O
in O
detail O
about O
it O
in O
the O
subreddit O
because O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
to O
do O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
like O
if O
I O
told O
my O
endo O
he O
would O
n't O
believe O
me O

Do O
you O
think O
I O
should O
mention O
i O
have O
the O
assessment O
coming O
up O
? O

I O
was O
only O
thinking O
because O
adhd O
is O
dopamine O
deficiency O
( O
as O
a O
very O
very O
simple O
explanation O
) O
and O
weed O
does O
give O
you O
dopamine O
and O
I O
think O
it O
makes O
sense O
as O
a O
reason O
for O
why O
I O
‚Äôve O
previously O
smoked O
, O
stopped O
for O
a O
year O
or O
a O
bit O
, O
smoked O
for O
a O
few O
years O
, O
had O
9 O
months O
not O
smoking O
. O

Then O
realised O
at O
least O
when O
I O
smoke O
I O
‚Äôm O
more O
even O
if O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
. O



 O
And O
I O
‚Äôve O
tried O
all O
the O
various O
mental O
health O
meds O
with O
smoking O
and O
without O
, O
so O
for O
a O
while O
propanolol B-DRUG
and O
weed O
worked O
but O
it O
made O
me O
more O
tense B-ADR
at O
night O
because O
it O
only O
works O
in O
your O
physical O
symptoms O
of O
anxiety B-ADR
, O
which O
is O
why O
it O
partners O
well O
with O
weed O
because O
that O
does O
calm O
your O
mind O
.. O
or O
mine O
at O
least O


 O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
working O
on O
my O
mental O
health O
for O
the O
last O
10 O
years O
to O
get O
to O
the O
point O
of O
getting O
adhd O
assessment O
and O
to O
have O
tried O
so O
many O
different O
medication O
, O
mindfulness O
and O
medication O
, O
caffeine O
intake O
, O
like O
I O
‚Äôve O
tried O
everything O
haha O
üòÇ O


 O
When O
I O
‚Äôm O
good O
I O
do O
everything O
and O
overachieve O
, O
when O
I O
‚Äôm O
bad O
I O
kinda O
underachieve O
a O
bit O
so O
it O
just O
takes O
longer O
. O

When O
I O
‚Äôm O
really O
bad O
I O
just O
shut O
down O
and O
it O
‚Äôs O
almost O
like O
mental B-ADR
paralysis I-ADR
. O



 O
Sorry O
for O
giving O
you O
so O
much O
information O
, O
I O
just O
like O
to O
be O
open O
when O
it O
‚Äôs O
things O
like O
this O

Prednisone B-DRUG
has O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
weird O
side O
effects O
like O
this O
( O
hence O
why O
it O
‚Äôs O
only O
used O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
) O
. O

Once O
you O
taper O
down O
the O
prednisone B-DRUG
and O
are O
just O
in O
the O
verapamil B-DRUG
it O
might O
go O
away O
, O
but O
you O
should O
mention O
it O
to O
your O
doctor O
in O
case O
they O
want O
to O
suggest O
a O
faster O
taper O
. O


I O
‚Äôm O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
since O
juli O
2018 O
. O

Last O
time O
I O
was O
sick B-ADR
was O
in O
January O
2018 O
: O
3 O
times O
flu O
after O
on O
another O
and O
i O
did O
n‚Äôt O
get O
to O
my O
old O
self O
back O
after O
that O
horrible O
experience O
. O

Due O
to O
that O
I O
‚Äôm O
very O
careful O
when O
it O
‚Äôs O
flu O
season O
. O

And O
than O
the O
pandemic O
hit O
. O



 O
Curious O
if O
the O
people O
who O
got O
COVID O
while O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
were O
all O
vaccinated O
and O
have O
antibodies O
made O
? O

I O
have O
3 O
basic O
vaccinations O
but O
no O
antibodies O
. O

First O
booster O
is O
planned O
2 O
weeks O
before O
next O
infusion O
end O
July O
. O



 O
I O
do O
not O
go O
to O
places O
that O
are O
crowed O
( O
no O
more O
concerts O
for O
me O
) O
, O
mask O
op O
everywhere O
indoors O
, O
groceries O
are O
getting O
delivered O
, O
ventilate O
all O
the O
time O
. O

But O
I O
‚Äôm O
also O
diabetic O
and O
am O
overweight O
, O
so O
I O
‚Äôm O
not O
so O
healthy O
as O
the O
persons O
above O
. O



 O
Since O
the O
pandemic O
I O
‚Äôm O
all O
the O
time O
care O
full O
instead O
of O
only O
in O
flu O
season O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
a O
new O
reality O
and O
I O
feel O
living O
outside O
normal O
society O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
crappy O
, O
but O
hee O
I O
‚Äôm O
still O
alive O
. O


So O
I O
have O
one O
kidney O
and O
I O
'm O
27 O
. O

My O
BP O
pretty O
much O
always O
runs O
140/90 O
. O

I O
am O
right O
at O
the O
normal O
/ O
overweight O
BMI O
. O

I O
eat O
fairly O
healthy O
compared O
to O
peers O
. O



 O
My O
doctor O
has O
me O
on O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
and O
I O
have O
a O
hunch O
and O
I O
have O
hope O
that O
this O
medicine O
will O
keep O
my O
kidney O
going O
for O
years O
to O
come O
. O

I O
guess O
this O
kind O
of O
medicine O
is O
perfect O
for O
people O
like O
me O

You O
might O
take O
a O
look O
at O
this O
community O
: O
https://www.stuffthatworks.health/hidradenitis-suppurativa/treatments?tab=MostEffective O

 O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
who O
came O
up O
with O
the O
website O
, O
but O
they O
find O
HS O
users O
and O
ask O
them O
about O
all O
the O
treatments O
they O
've O
tried O
and O
how O
effective O
they O
've O
been O
, O
then O
rank O
the O
treatments O
. O



 O
HS O
is O
an O
immune O
system O
disorder O
that O
causes O
your O
immune O
system O
to O
attack O
healthy O
cells O
/ O
tissue O
. O

That O
's O
why O
many O
people O
with O
severe O
HS O
have O
been O
helped O
by O
drugs O
that O
suppress O
the O
immune O
system O
a O
bit O
, O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Remicade B-DRUG
. O

  O
It O
sounds O
like O
those O
treatments O
would O
be O
really O
extreme O
for O
your O
case O
, O
so O
I O
would O
start O
trying O
more O
basic O
things O
like O
lifestyle O
or O
diet O
changes O
, O
like O
decreasing O
your O
intake O
of O
sugar O

those O

be O
big O

people O

And O
many O
are O
available O
very O
cheap O
without O

For O
example O
, O
just O
the O
first O
couple O
on O
the O

Lisinopril B-DRUG

available O
for O

The O
highest O
price O
locally O
for O
lipitor B-DRUG
in O
my O
city O
is O
$ O
30 O
, O
with O
the O
average O
price O
being O
about O

12 O

I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
either O
I O
had O

take O
fiber O
before O
I O
got O
on O
metformin B-DRUG

Now O
I O
definitely O
poop O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
moderate O
UC O
in O
April O
2020 O
, O
was O
on O
mesalamine B-DRUG
both O
ends O
until O
I O
was O
in O
a O
severe O
flare B-ADR
in O
October O
. O

Switched O
GIs O
and O
I O
started O
humira B-DRUG
in O
November O
. O

I O
stopped O
humira B-DRUG
6 O
weeks O
ago O
because O
I O
never O
reached O
therapeutic O
levels O
. O



 O
I O
've O
been O
on O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
for O
3 O
weeks O
and O
already O
have O
seen O
so O
much O
improvement O
. O

I O
'm O
down O
to O
3 O
semiformed O
bms O
daily O
& O
very O
little O
urgency O
. O

I O
can O
fart O
again O
! O

No O
waking O
to O
diarrhea B-ADR
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
! O

Rinvoq B-DRUG
is O
also O
cheaper O
than O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
although O
my O
insurance O
fought O
my O
dr O
about O
it O
for O
3 O
weeks O
trading O
paperwork O
. O



 O
I O
do O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
have O
been O
on O
30 O
mg O
prednisone B-DRUG
daily O
for O
the O
last O
3 O
months O
. O

The O
prednisone B-DRUG
was O
keeping O
me O
somewhat O
stable O
& O
I O
started O
tapering O
today O
. O



 O
I O
wo O
n't O
measure O
my O
calprotectin O
for O
another O
few O
weeks O
, O
that O
'll O
be O
the O
real O
test O
to O
see O
how O
I O
'm O
doing O
, O
my O
last O
level O
was O
3100 O
. O



 O
I O
like O
the O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
, O
it O
's O
one O
pill O
once O
a O
day O
, O
no O
side O
effects O
so O
far O
. O

I O
think O
the O
most O
common O
one O
is O
high O
cholesterol O
, O
which O
is O
tested O
starting O
at O
12 O
weeks O
. O



 O
I O
'd O
also O
like O
to O
hear O
from O
others O
who O
have O
been O
on O
for O
longer O
, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
's O
so O
new O
that O
there O
are O
few O
people O

 O
The O
only O
thing O
that O
has O
helped O
me O
for O
dizziness B-ADR
-- O
and O
I O
have O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
doctors O
-- O
is O
when O
the O
neurologist O
prescribed O
Clonazepam B-DRUG
/ O
Klonopin B-DRUG
1 O
mg O
. O

I O
hate O
to O
say O
that O
, O
because O
that O
's O
a O
drug O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
take O
every O
day O
or O
long O
term O
since O
it O
's O
addictive B-ADR
. O

I O
was O
very O
careful O
about O
how O
I O
took O
it O
so O
that O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
issues O
. O

I O
've O
also O
been O
prescribed O
Furosemide B-DRUG
, O
which O
is O
a O
diuretic O
that O
helps O
sometimes O
but O
not O
completely O
. O

I O
am O
someone O
who O
loves O
salt O
, O
though O
, O
so O
Furosemide B-DRUG
is O
good O
for O
that O
. O



 O
I O
am O
also O
possibly O
thinking O
of O
possible O
nerve O
issues O
in O
relation O
to O
your O
symptoms O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
know O
much O
about O
how O
those O
are O
discovered O
/ O
diagnosed O
. O



 O
It O
's O
interesting O
you O
mention O
anxiety B-ADR
. O

I O
have O
a O
theory O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
us O
who O
have O
had O
Meniere O
's O
mentioned O
to O
us O
or O
who O
are O
suspicious O
that O
we O
have O
it O
actually O
have O
overactive O
/ O
overstimulated O
nerves O
or O
nervous B-ADR
systems O
. O

Yours O
might O
not O
be O
causing O
you O
anxiety B-ADR
symptoms O
anymore O
, O
but O
maybe O
it O
's O
still O
causing O
issues O
with O
dizziness B-ADR
and O
other O
issues O
. O

I O
have O
mild O
anxiety B-ADR
and O
experience O
dizziness B-ADR
pretty O
much O
daily O
( O
I O
can O
still O
function O
and O
work O
, O
though O
) O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
also O
has O
anxiety B-ADR
and O
gets O
dizzy B-ADR
at O
times O
. O

So O
, O
I O
am O
curious O
if O
a O
different O
class O
of O
anxiety B-ADR
medication O
would O
help O
with O
your O
dizziness B-ADR
, O
like O
an O
anticonvulsant O
like O
Klonopin B-DRUG
. O

You O
could O
see O
a O
neurologist O
about O
this O
. O


I O
wish O
I O
had O
the O
balls O
to O
hold O
up O
a O
line O
like O
that O
when O
I O
'm O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
pain B-ADR
due O
to O
my O
disability O
making O
it O
hard O
to O
walk O
long O
distances O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
too O
afraid O
of O
people O
questioning O
me O
or O
judging O
me O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
simple O
accommodation O
in O
public O
. O

I O
would O
just O
suffer O
through O
the O
pain B-ADR
and O
grab O
it O
myself O
, O
too O
bad O
my O
ocrevus B-DRUG
does O
n't O
stop O
the O
muscle B-ADR
spasticity I-ADR
that O
makes O
walking O
painful B-ADR
. O

 

 O
It O
was O
just O
a O
cucumber O
she O
forgot O
. O

I O
get O
it O
's O
annoying O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
in O
line O
longer O
but O
it O
's O
nice O
to O
have O
empathy O
for O
people O
struggling O
with O
the O
same O
disorder O
you O
have O
. O

It O
's O
posts O
and O
comments O
like O
this O
that O
make O
people O
suffer O
in O
silence O
to O
avoid O
being O
called O
a O
faker O
lol O
. O


Do O
you O
take O
anything O
for O
your O
chrons O
? O



 O
And O
thanks O
for O
that O
info O
. O

I O
think O
I O
saw O
that O
article O
and O
maybe O
started O
spiraling O
that O
ocrevus B-DRUG
caused O
my O
chrons O
and O
I O
was O
really O
upsetting O
myself O
because O
my O
MS O
has O
been O
doing O
so O
good O
on O
ocrevus B-DRUG
. O

Def O
helped O
calm O
me O
down O
üòÜ O

So O
what O
? O

What O
is O
the O
point O
of O
demonizing O
drugs O
? O

I O
'm O
clean O
off O
heroin O
, O
but O
everybody O
should O
be O
free O
to O
make O
their O
own O
decision O
regarding O
drug O
use O
because O
they O
're O
going O
to O
, O
regardless O
, O
and O
a O
significant O
percentage O
of O
the O
population O
will O
always O
find O
life O
unbearable O
without O
drugs O
. O

Drugs O
saved O
my O
life O
, O
until O
I O
started O
to O
kill O
myself O
with O
them O
, O
but O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
problems O
I O
've O
encountered O
with O
drugs O
never O
would O
have O
occurred O
if O
all O
drugs O
were O
legal O
, O
and O
if O
total O
abstinence O
was O
n't O
the O
end O
- O
all O
be O
- O
all O
of O
drug O
education O
. O

They O
tell O
you O
drugs O
will O
destroy O
your O
life O
, O
so O
you O
start O
doing O
drugs O
expecting O
your O
life O
to O
be O
destroyed O
, O
and O
everybody O
else O
figures O
you O
've O
got O
it O
coming O
to O
you O
because O
they O
're O
just O
a O
bunch O
of O
brainwashed O
zombies O
on O
Prozac B-DRUG
. O

Drug O
prohibition O
ensures O
heroin O
( O
likely O
cut O
with O
fentantyl O
) O
is O
one O
of O
the O
only O
drugs O
that O
anybody O
of O
any O
age O
can O
access O
without O
an O
ID O
. O



 O
All O
drug O
demonization O
does O
is O
ensure O
criminals O
maintain O
a O
monopoly O
on O
one O
if O
the O
biggest O
industries O
on O
the O
planet O
so O
a O
lot O
of O
otherwise O
unemployable O
psychopaths O
can O
keep O
shaking O
down O
taxpayers O
for O
protection O
money O

just O

It O
helped O
me O
to O
take O
it O

. O


I O
was O
taking O
hydrochlorothiazide B-DRUG

is O
a O
diuretic O
used O
for O
blood O
pressure O
and O
I O
had O
  O
no O

put O
me O
at O

developing O

My O
blood O

is O
usually O
below O
112 O

My O
PKD O
specialist O
says O
patients O
should O
try O
to O
stay O
under O
110 O
but O
it O
‚Äôs O
a O
fine O
line O
to O
walk O
because O
anything O
below O
110 O
is O
considered O
low B-ADR

a O
bad O

If O

I O

I O
read O
that O
some O

are O
able O

on O
prozac B-DRUG

Unfortunately O
, O

does O
n't O
work O
well O
for O
me O

It O
really O
messes O
up O

If O

‚Äú O
Ocrevus B-DRUG

Kesimpta B-DRUG
‚Äù O
in O
this O
sub O
you O
should O
be O
able O
to O
find O
some O
good O
info O

 O
I O
was O
on O
Rituxan B-DRUG
( O
essentially O
the O
same O
as O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
/ O
ocrelizumab O
) O
but O
stopped O
at O
the O
end O
of O
2019 O
and O
switched O
to O
Kesimpta B-DRUG
/ O
ofatumumab B-DRUG
in O
April O
2021 O
. O

I O
prefer O
Kesimpta B-DRUG
because O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
mind O
self O
- O
injections O
and O
do O
n‚Äôt O
have O
to O
spend O
time O
at O
an O
infusion O
center O
. O


I O
just O
want O
to O
add O
a O
cautionary O
tale O
about O
cholesterol O
medication O
. O

Turns O
out O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
was O
damaging B-ADR
my I-ADR
liver I-ADR
. O

Once O
I O
switched O
meds O
my O
liver O
levels O
were O
fine O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
scary O
time O
! O


Our O
cat O
just O
went O
through O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

He O
is O
16 O
y O
/ O
o. O
He O
's O
had O
hyperthyroidism B-ADR
for O
the O
past O
two O
years O
. O

Make O
sure O
they O
check O
his O
thyroid O
! O

He O
needed O
the O
fluid O
to O
be O
drained O
and O
he O
spent O
6 O
hours O
in O
an O
oxygen O
chamber O
the O
next O
day O
. O

He O
is O
doing O
fine O
now O
. O

However O
, O
our O
vet O
added O
two O
new O
meds O
, O
beside O
the O
hyperthyroidism B-ADR
one O
he O
was O
already O
taking O
, O
it O
's O
vetmedin O
and O
furosemide B-DRUG
for O
his O
heart O
, O
and O
furosemide B-DRUG
is O
diuretic O
which O
will O
also O
keep O
the O
fluid O
from O
building O
up O
around O
his O
lungs O
again O
. O



 O
üáµ O
üá± O
Lots O
of O
love O
to O
Kropek O
! O


I O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
I O
would O
call O
it O
being O
" O
put O
on O
" O
medication O
. O

I O
have O
a O
hunch O
that O
it O
is O
much O
different O
than O
you O
think O
. O

I O
look O
at O
it O
as O
a O
gift O
to O
help O
people O
like O
me O
. O

The O
situation O
is O
similar O
to O
a O
diabetic O
needing O
insulin O
. O

Some O
people O
just O
need O
it O
. O



 O
In O
the O
Eighties O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
shrink O
whom O
I O
liked O
a O
lot O
but O
a O
year O
went O
by O
with O
little O
progress O
. O

I O
still O
had O
panic B-ADR
attacks I-ADR
and O
terrible O
anxiety B-ADR
. O

  O
At O
that O
time O
Prozac B-DRUG
was O
new O
on O
the O
market O
. O

My O
shrink O
did O
not O
believe O
in O
medication O
, O
so O
he O
did O
not O
mention O
it O
to O
me O
as O
a O
possibility O
. O

Finally O
, O
after O
a O
year O
, O
he O
prescribed O
Prozac B-DRUG
. O

I O
did O
n't O
think O
it O
would O
do O
anything O
as O
he O
had O
been O
so O
against O
it O
. O

It O
blew O
me O
away O
. O

It O
was O
night O
and O
day O
and O
I O
felt O
angry B-ADR
he O
had O
not O
provided O
it O
sooner O
. O



 O
I O
still O
had O
issues O
but O
not O
the O
extreme O
lows O
. O

I O
was O
steady O
and O
able O
to O
go O
to O
grad O
school O
. O



 O
Frankly O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
there O
's O
such O
a O
stigma O
with O
meds O
for O
depression B-ADR
and O
anxiety B-ADR
. O

If O
it O
helps O
, O
why O
not O
? O


Folic B-DRUG
acid I-DRUG
helps O
a O
lot O
with O
side O
effects O
, O
as O
far O
as O
the O
immune O
system O
compromising O
, O
i O
‚Äôve O
gotten O
one O
serious O
cold O
since O
i O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
methotrexate B-DRUG
; O
I O
got O
it O
from O
my O
SIL O
, O
it O
lasted O
3 O
days O
for O
her O
, O
5 O
weeks O
for O
me O
. O

Exhaustion B-ADR
, O
sore B-ADR
throat I-ADR
, O
cough B-ADR
, O
congestion B-ADR
. O

I O
needed O
two O
rounds O
of O
steroids O
and O
2 O
different O
antibiotics O
to O
eventually O
beat O
it O
. O



 O
Wash O
your O
hands O
, O
wear O
a O
mask O
when O
you O
can O
, O
explain O
to O
friends O
and O
family O
that O
they O
need O
to O
make O
you O
aware O
if O
they O
are O
sick B-ADR
. O



 O
My O
R O
told O
me O
that O
as O
long O
as O
my O
colds O
do O
n‚Äôt O
result O
in O
a O
high O
fever B-ADR
or O
low B-ADR
O2 I-ADR
, O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
need O
to O
go O
to O
emergency O
, O
but O
upper B-ADR
respiratory I-ADR
infections I-ADR
can O
be O
very O
dangerous O
! O


there O
's O
a O
10 O
mg O
version O
you O
would O
need O
to O
get O
from O
your O
doctor O
, O
often O
you O
would O
be O
put O
on O
something O
like O
prozac B-DRUG
as O
well O
briefly O
to O
help O
. O


I O
was O
on O
60 O
mg O
propanolol B-DRUG
very O
briefly O
, O
only O
took O
it O
3 O
times O
but O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
got O
some O
adrenal O
rebound O
for O
weeks O
after O
I O
quit O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
how O
bad O
a O
cold O
turkey O
would O
be O
after O
long O
term O
use O
. O



 O
Sadly O
, O
I O
think O
your O
CNS O
just O
gets O
more O
and O
more O
sensitive O
, O
the O
more O
you O
change O
up O
drugs O
. O

I O
messed O
up O
mine O
badly O
over O
the O
last O
3 O
months O
. O

Right O
now O
I O
'm O
so O
sensitive O
that O
I O
took O
benadryl B-DRUG
for O
allergies B-ADR
for O
3 O
days O
and O
then O
when O
I O
stopped O
I O
got O
withdrawals B-ADR
and O
now O
I O
'm O
tapering O
that O
. O

Totally O
ridiculous O
, O
I O
used O
to O
be O
able O
to O
take O
any O
drug O
in O
the O
world O
and O
now O
I O
ca O
n't O
take O
a O
benadryl B-DRUG
? O

But O
else O
what O
can O
I O
do O
? O



 O
I O
'm O
also O
now O
learning O
that O
all O
pills O
are O
risky O
, O
the O
less O
I O
take O
the O
better O
. O

If O
I O
'd O
simply O
taken O
nothing O
since O
the O
start O
of O
my O
withdrawals B-ADR
, O
I O
'd O
probably O
be O
better O
than O
having O
taken O
all O
the O
stuff O
I O
tried O
to O
fix O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
also O
learning O
that O
the O
less O
changes O
I O
make O
, O
and O
the O
slower O
I O
make O
those O
changes O
, O
the O
better O
I O
feel O
. O



 O
You O
know O
the O
site O
survivingantidepressants O
? O

Look O
at O
their O
forums O
and O
look O
at O
people O
's O
signatures O
and O
the O
way O
they O
quit O
each O
and O
every O
med O
very O
slowly O
over O
a O
few O
years O
. O

That O
's O
probably O
going O
to O
be O
your O
journey O
. O

I O
think O
you O
'll O
have O
an O
unstable O
period O
where O
you O
find O
the O
right O
mix O
of O
meds O
to O
feel O
pretty O
good O
on O
, O
and O
then O
do O
the O
long O
tapering O
from O
there O
and O
stay O
stable O
while O
you O
take O
less O
and O
less O
. O



 O
Klonopin B-DRUG
withdrawal B-ADR
is O
a O
tricky O
one O
in O
that O
it O
will O
creep O
up O
on O
you O
. O

Like O
you O
'll O
stop O
taking O
it O
and O
you O
'll O
feel O
fine O
and O
then O
4 O
- O
5 O
days O
in O
maybe O
your O
sleep O
gets O
worse O
and O
6 O
- O
7 O
days O
in O
your O
heart O
starts O
pounding O
and O
you O
've O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
adrenaline O
and O
you O
finally O
realize O
you O
're O
in O
withdrawal B-ADR
. O



 O
Like O
, O
you O
might O
get O
lucky O
and O
find O
out O
you O
're O
not O
dependent O
at O
all O
. O

And O
then O
you O
're O
done O
with O
it O
, O
that O
'd O
be O
great O
. O

But O
you O
might O
find O
out O
a O
week O
later O
that O
you O
're O
in O
klonopin B-DRUG
withdrawal B-ADR
and O
you O
basically O
just O
quit O
cold O
turkey O
, O
it O
just O
has O
n't O
hit O
yet O
. O

  O
Then O
you O
would O
need O
to O
either O
go O
through O
a O
month O
of O
bad O
symptoms O
or O
go O
back O
on O
it O
and O
restabilize O
. O



 O
Basically O
, O
there O
's O
some O
risk O
in O
how O
you O
're O
testing O
it O
. O

It O
might O
work O
out O
, O
if O
you O
're O
lucky O
and O
did O
n't O
get O
addicted B-ADR
, O
it O
might O
not O
. O

You O
at O
least O
need O
to O
have O
a O
plan O
in O
mind O
for O
what O
you O
're O
going O
to O
do O
/ O
take O
if O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
out O
. O


In O
2019 O
I O
began O
injecting O
40 O
mg O
every O
2 O
weeks O
, O
then O
in O
2021 O
I O
noticed O
stiffness B-ADR
and O
pain B-ADR
towards O
the O
end O
of O
my O
cycle O
and O
my O
doctor O
suggested O
every O
10 O
days O
. O

That O
's O
been O
going O
well O
for O
me O
. O



 O
Edit O
: O
just O
saw O
your O
part O
b. O
I O
'm O
in O
Canada O
so O
maybe O
things O
are O
different O
, O
but O
insurance O
was O
n't O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
once O
I O
got O
special O
authorization O
from O
my O
rheum O
. O

Unfortunately O
my O
provider O
stopped O
covering O
special O
medications O
this O
year O
, O
but O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
support O
program O
has O
really O
stepped O
up O
in O
that O
regard O
and O
I O
get O
provincial O
assistance O
since O
it O
is O
a O
high O
cost O
medication O
. O


I O
am O
, O
but O
I O
was O
this O
way O
before O
the O
metformin B-DRUG
so O
it O
‚Äôs O
not O
why O
. O

Just O
part O
of O
who O
I O
am O

What O
's O
your O
dosage O
? O

My O
Doc O
is O
bumping O
my O
prednisone B-DRUG
up O
to O
60 O
mg O
a O
day O

At O
21 O
you O
can O
probably O
eat O
raw O
bacon O
and O
drink O
butter O
and O
still O
have O
good O
blood O
work O
. O

What O
‚Äôs O
important O
is O
developing O
habits O
that O
will O
keep O
you O
healthy O
for O
the O
next O
70 O
years O
. O



 O
Blood O
work O
is O
good O
until O
it O
‚Äôs O
not O
, O
and O
by O
then O
it O
‚Äôs O
usually O
too O
late O
. O

You O

Hey O
guys O
, O
my O
doctor O
has O
been O
experimenting O
with O
things O
that O
will O
help O
me O
feel O
like O
myself O
again O
and O
get O
rid O

my O
horrible O
anxiety B-ADR

the O

being O
Bupropion B-DRUG

and O
Sertraline B-DRUG
50 O

. O

I O
‚Äôm O
scared O
of O
what O
the O
combo O
will O
do O
so O
just O
wanted O
to O
get O
some O
insight O
before O
I O
decide O
to O
combine O
. O


Taking O
a O
short O
term O
of O
Prozac B-DRUG
was O
the O
only O
way O
I O
could O
stop O
Effexor B-DRUG

I O
take O
propranolol B-DRUG
along O
with O
a O
medication O
called O
sertraline B-DRUG
and O
I O
remember O
when O
I O
started O
off O
on O
it O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
was O
awful O
but O
over O
the O
course O
of O
about O
3 O
months O
it O
helped O
me O
out O
a O
ton O
. O

Just O
remember O
to O
talk O
to O
your O
physician O
because O
they O
'll O
probably O
know O
more O
about O
the O
med O
and O
your O
situation O
than O
a O
bunch O
of O
redditors O
do O
. O


How O
long O
have O
you O
taken O
them O
for O
? O

I O
'm O
on O
propanolol B-DRUG
and O
had O
similar O
symptoms O
to O
you O
for O
the O
first O
few O
days O
/ O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
then O
it O
settled O
down O
and O
I O
've O
not O
had O
that O
feeling O
since O

It O
's O
delay O
of O
execution O
to O
my O
view O
. O

  O
One O
of O
the O
effects O
of O
Simvastatin B-DRUG
( O
and O
Atorvastatin B-DRUG
) O
is O
that O
it O
increases O
the O
deformability O
of O
the O
red O
blood O
cells O
. O

  O
This O
way O
they O
can O
squeeze O
through O
narrow O
spaces O
easier O
. O



 O
On O
top O
it O
aids O
in O
reducing O
clotting B-ADR
. O

 

 O
But O
neither O
the O
deformability O
nor O
the O
anticoagulant O
effects O
will O
reduce O
damage O
to O
the O
endothelium O

  O
The O
4S O
study O
was O
done O
with O
a O
median O
follow O
up O
of O
5.4 O
years O
. O

  O
I O
can O
only O
wonder O
by O
how O
much O
it O
delays O
the O
event O
. O

  O
You O
may O
win O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
if O
would O
die O
from O
your O
event O
but O
those O
couple O
of O
years O
are O
likely O
spent O
in O
a O
diseased O
state O
so O
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
continue O
with O
a O
crappy O
lifestyle O
and O
take O
simvastatin B-DRUG

no O

I O
do O
well O

Propanolol B-DRUG
works O
to O
block O

so O
it O
is O
very O
effective O

It O
will O
lower B-ADR

make O
sure O

The O
truth O
is O
over O
- O
diagnosis O
and O
overprescription O
has O
lead O
to O
an O
epidemic O
in O
our O
country O
fueled O
by O
capitalistic O
health O
care O
. O

Europe O
and O
Canada O
is O
part O
of O
it O
too O
. O



 O
Psychiatry O
has O
lost O
its O
meaning O
. O

They O
are O
just O
sales O
men O
for O
pharma O
who O
go O
through O
a O
fudged O
legal O
procedure O
to O
actually O
diagnose O
and O
prescribe O
you O
. O



 O
Why O
is O
it O
3 O
doctors O
can O
diagnose O
you O
3 O
incredibly O
different O
and O
interacting O
diagnosis O
‚Äôs O
‚Ä¶ O
because O
it O
‚Äôs O
just O
guess O
and O
check O
these O
days O
. O

Guessing O
and O
checking O
off O
of O
a O
bullshit O
foundation O
, O
so O
all O
the O
meds O
could O
have O
been O
for O
nothing O
. O



 O
What O
I O
‚Äôm O
getting O
at O
is O
psychiatric O
drugs O
are O
very O
harmful O
, O
yet O
some O
people O
very O
much O
so O
need O
them O
because O
the O
benefits O
outweighs O
the O
side O
effects O
/ O
cons O
. O



 O
For O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
population O
though O
, O
( O
who O
have O
been O
misdiagnosed O
due O
to O
environmental O
, O
trauma O
, O
abuse O
, O
whatever O
) O
they O
do O
n‚Äôt O
need O
these O
powerful O
, O
little O
efficacy O
, O
mind O
altering O
drugs O
. O



 O
I O
have O
trauma O
and O
genetic O
induced O
anxiety B-ADR
. O

I O
should O
have O
never O
been O
put O
on O
Zoloft B-DRUG
or O
Paxil B-DRUG

 O
Edit O
: O
I O
feel O
anti O
- O
psychiatry O
/ O
psychiatry O
abuse O
has O
become O
so O
common O
because O
most O
people O
need O
emotional O
health O
. O

Not O
mind O
altering O
medication O
, O
which O
all O
psychiatry O
really O
is O
these O
days O
. O


I O
've O
had O
PCOS O
symptoms O
as O
long O
as O
I O
can O
remember O
and O
just O
got O
diagnosed O
with O
it O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
based O
off O
my O
testosterone O
levels O
, O
hirsutism B-ADR
, O
anxiety B-ADR
, O
depression B-ADR
and O
super O
difficult O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
my O
belly O
fat O
- O
even O
with O
portion O
control O
and O
walking O
for O
20 O
to O
30 O
minutes O
a O
day O
, O
five O
days O
a O
week O
while O
on O
my O
lunchbreak O
. O



 O
I O
tried O
laser O
hair O
removal O
and O
that O
seemed O
to O
make O
the O
hair O
grow O
back O
faster O
. O

I O
used O
to O
get O
waxed O
every O
3 O
weeks O
, O
and O
that O
got O
too O
expensive O
, O
so O
I O
buy O
the O
strips O
you O
warm O
up O
in O
your O
hands O
and O
do O
it O
myself O
. O

I O
also O
have O
sugar O
wax O
that O
I O
use O
. O



 O
I O
have O
tried O
shaving O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
leave O
alot O
of O
stubble O
, O
so O
then O
I O
try O
to O
tweeze O
it O
all O
out O
it O
hurts O
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
bought O
me O
one O
of O
those O
" O
as O
seen O
on O
tv O
" O
trimmer O
things O
and O
I O
used O
it O
tonight O
. O

It O
did O
leave O
some O
stubble O
, O
but O
not O
as O
bad O
as O
a O
razor O
and O
left O
my O
face O
SUPER O
soft O
. O

Like O
, O
holy O
crap O
. O

My O
face O
has O
n't O
been O
this O
soft O
since O
I O
was O
a O
kid O
. O



 O
My O
dr O
put O
me O
on O
1500 O
mg O
metformin B-DRUG
and O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
to O
see O
if O
that O
helps O
as O
well O
. O



 O
I O
wish O
you O
luck O
! O

! O

! O

This O
shit O
sucks O
and O
wish O
SOMEONE O
would O
have O
diagnosed O
me O
literally O
decades O
ago O
, O
but O
no O
one O
would O
do O
bloodwork O
because O
" O
you O
get O
your O
period O
monthly O
, O
so O
you O
're O
fine O
" O
. O



 O
I O
've O
already O
told O
my O
boss O
, O
even O
if O
you O
drop O
the O
mask O
requirement O
, O
I O
'm O
still O
wearing O
mine O
. O

I O
feel O
protected O
in O
a O
way O
and O
so O
glad O
I O
can O
hide O
my O
face O
. O


Thanks O
she O
is O
very O
happy O
with O
ocrevus B-DRUG
, O
her O
ms O
was O
doing O
fine O
with O
copaxone B-DRUG
( O
no O
new O
lesions B-ADR
or O
new O
symptoms O
) O
but O
after O
she O
started O
ocrevus B-DRUG
some O
of O
her O
old O
symptoms O
went O
away O
. O

The O
funny O
thing O
is O
that O
she O
was O
n‚Äôt O
looking O
to O
change O
her O
treatment O
and O
now O
she O
ca O
n‚Äôt O
even O
think O
about O
going O
back O
. O

I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
understand O
the O
part O
about O
tysabri B-DRUG
, O
they O
wo O
n‚Äôt O
let O
you O
have O
the O
infusion O
6 O
weeks O
apart O
even O
if O
that O
put O
you O
at O
risk O
because O
of O
jvc B-ADR
positive I-ADR
? O


I O
did O
something O
similar O
last O
year O
when O
I O
knew O
I O
was O
losing O
my O
health O
care O
/ O
COBRA O
. O

Every O
prescription O
I O
kept O
renewing O
through O
my O
prescription O
provider O
whether O
I O
needed O
it O
or O
not O
. O

Have O
a O
year O
or O
more O
supply O
of O
sumatriptan B-DRUG
for O
my O
migraines B-ADR
, O
prednisone B-DRUG
and O
hydroxychloroquine B-DRUG
for O
my O
lupus B-ADR
, O
Advair B-DRUG
for O
asthma B-ADR
, O
etc O
. O


Yeah O
I O
asked O
them O
to O
prescribe O
me O
Propanolol B-DRUG
as O
I O
‚Äôve O
used O
that O
sometimes O
too O
but O
they O
did O
n‚Äôt O
want O
to O
. O

They O
‚Äôve O
prescribed O
me O
an O
anti O
nausea B-ADR
instead O
to O
help O
with O
those O
symptoms O
which O
are O
always O
the O
worst O
for O
me O
. O


Your O
right O
that O
xanax B-DRUG
does O
n't O
help O
with O
seizures B-ADR
, O
the O
other O
day O
i O
seen O
a O
neurologist O
and O
got O
a O
prescription O
for O
seizures B-ADR
( O
but O
also O
works O
as O
for O
anxiety B-ADR
ext)i O
was O
n't O
going O
to O
take O
it O
because O
what O
started O
the O
seizures B-ADR
was O
prozac B-DRUG
and O
then O
they O
tried O
5 O
other O
ssri O
and O
snri O
until O
i O
said O
fuck O
no O
more O
antidepressants O
, O
but O
this O
new O
one O
is O
a O
anticonvulsant O
and O
the O
function O
of O
this O
medication O
( O
forgot O
the O
name O
) O
seemed O
promising O
and O
waay O
better O
then O
other O
antidepressant O

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant O


 O
But O
yea O
i O
was O
surprised O
when O
she O
chose O
xanax B-DRUG
over O
alprazolam B-DRUG
but O
i O
like O
the O
feeling O
of O
xanax B-DRUG
but O
clonazepam B-DRUG
is O
definitely O
better O
for O
going O
outside O
and O
socializing O
xanax B-DRUG
just O
felt O
really O
good O
and O
help O
sleep O
but O
its O
only O
my O
first O
day O
so O
i O
ca O
nt O
really O
say O

Ok O
I O
looked O
up O
my O
old O
vet O
records O
. O

You O
are O
correct O
, O
they O
did O
do O
an O
echocardiogram O
for O
both O
dogs O
. O

For O
my O
dog O
that O
passed O
in O
2019 O
they O
diagnosed O
him O
with O
mild O
degenerative O
mitral O
and O
tricuspid O
valve O
disease O
and O
said O
the O
left O
ventricle O
is O
normal O
in O
both O
systole O
and O
diastole O
with O
moderate O
mitral B-ADR
regurgitation I-ADR
and O
normal O
left O
atrial O
size O
. O

The O
right O
heart O
is O
subjectively O
normal O
in O
size O
with O
mild O
tricuspid O
regurgitation B-ADR
and O
no O
evidence O
of O
hypertension B-ADR
. O

Recommend O
discontinue O
therapy O
of O
furosemide B-DRUG
and O
enalapril O
. O



 O
1 O
month O
later O
they O
did O
another O
echo O
and O
had O
us O
discontinue O
the O
Vetmedin O
since O
his O
heart O
had O
not O
changed O
in O
size O
. O

But O
3 O
months O
later O
we O
ended O
up O
at O
the O
emergency O
vet O
with O
an O
enlarged B-ADR
heart I-ADR
and O
fluid O
in O
his O
lungs O
and O
they O
tried O
pumping O
him O
with O
furosemide B-DRUG
but O
it O
had O
no O
effect O
and O
we O
had O
to O
put O
him O
down O
due O
to O
congestive B-ADR
heart I-ADR
failure I-ADR

the O
biggest O
problem O
with O
Lucy O

I O
had O
originally O
wondered O

which O
I O
had O
not O

I O
have O

people O
talk O
about O

I O
'm O
addressing O
the O
issue O
on O
several O
fronts O

but O
that O
's O
actually O
my O
big O
reason O
for O
being O
personally O
interested O
in O
this O
idea O
. O


Two O
years O
and O
it O
sucks O
! O

Terminated O
from O
several O
jobs O
due O
to O
migraines B-ADR
and O
depression B-ADR
. O

Migraines B-ADR
caused O
severe O
depression B-ADR
now O
they O
feed O
off O
of O
each O
other O
. O

I O
feel B-ADR
awful I-ADR
everyday O
, O
all O
day O
from O
depression B-ADR
or O
migraines B-ADR
. O

I O
never O
get O
a O
pain B-ADR
free O
day O
. O

Going O
out O
is O
the O
worse O
where O
I O
have O
to O
pretend O
to O
be O
okay O
when O
  O
I O
'm O
not O
. O

I O
've O
tried O
ssri O
, O
beta O
blockers O
, O
triptans O
, O
muscle O
relaxers O
, O
prednisone B-DRUG
and O
nothing O
helps O
. O

Migraines B-ADR
also O
cause O
a O
fever B-ADR
so O
I O
have O
to O
use O
an O
ice O
pack O
daily O
. O

It O
's O
frustrating O
that O
I O
went O
to O
college O
, O
took O
out O
all O
those O
student O
loans O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
work O
because O
I O
can O
barely O
function O
. O

Not O
sure O
why O
life O
has O
to O
be O
so O
miserable O
. O


This O
is O
a O
little O
different O
, O
but O
I O
‚Äôm O
on O
Citalopram B-DRUG
( O
generic O
for O
Celexa B-DRUG
) O
. O

Your O
Escitalolpram B-DRUG
is O
generic O
for O
Lexapro B-DRUG
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
heard O
these O
2 O
drugs O
are O
basically O
sister O
drugs O
and O
function B-ADR
in O
a O
similar O
fashion O
. O

Never O
taken O
Strattera B-DRUG
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
that O
I O
love O
my O
citalopram B-DRUG
( O
30 O
mg O
) O
. O

I O
take O
it O
for O
depression B-ADR
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
what O
finally O
got O
my O
out O
of O
my O
really O
bad O
depression B-ADR
last O
year O
. O

( O
I O
had O
been O
on O
Prozac B-DRUG
for O
many O
years O
, O
but O
I O
think O
my O
body O
got O
used O
to O
it O
) O


 O
Also O
my O
sister O
, O
who O
is O
weary O
of O
meds O
and O
tries O
to O
stick O
to O
everything O
natural O
, O
ended O
up O
taking O
escitalopram B-DRUG

had O
no O
issues O
with O
it O

 O
Good O

Ô∏è O

I O

Tecfidera B-DRUG

a O
while O
before O
just O
recently O
switching O
to O
ocrevus B-DRUG

The O
first O
few O
weeks O
are O
really O
just O
getting O
adjusted O
, O
I O
would O
suggest O
taking O
it O
with O
food O
for O
a O
while O
until O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O

I O
eventually O
got O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
need O
to O
eat O

all O
all O
taking O
it O

Lipitor B-DRUG

Take O
inositol B-DRUG
! O

I O
‚Äôm O
only O
half O
kidding O
. O

It O
helps O
a O
lot O
with O
PCOS O
symptoms O
, O
and O
excess O
poop O
is O
a O
side O
effect O
üí© O
. O

Magnesium O
also O
can O
have O
that O
effect O
on O
me O
. O



 O
Edit O
in O
case O
it O
‚Äôs O
useful O
: O


 O
In O
the O
short O
and O
medium O
terms O
, O
Inositol O
has O
been O
found O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
metformin B-DRUG
( O
and O
in O
some O
studies O
more O
so O
) O
with O
less O
side O
effects O
. O

Not O
only O
does O
it O
help O
control O
blood O
sugar O
and O
reduce O
insulin B-ADR
resistance I-ADR
the O
way O
metformin B-DRUG
does O
, O
it O
also O
helps O
reduce O
inflammation B-ADR
, O
lower B-ADR
cholesterol I-ADR
, O
improve O
egg O
quality O
, O
curb O
hunger O
and O
reduce O
sugar O
cravings O
. O

All O
of O
this O
can O
also O
help O
indirectly O
with O
hyperandrogenism B-ADR
driven O
by O
insulin B-ADR
resistance I-ADR
. O



 O
It O
can O
cause O
headaches B-ADR
and O
digestive B-ADR
issues I-ADR
at O
first O
, O
so O
you O
might O
want O
to O
ease O
into O
it O
. O

Make O
sure O
to O
take O
the O
40:1 O
ratio O
because O
that O
‚Äôs O
what O
the O
research O
suggests O
is O
most O
effective O
for O
PCOS O
. O

Ovasitol O
and O
WholesomeStory O
are O
both O
reputable O
brands O
. O



 O
If O
not O
, O
be O
aware O
that O
purchasing O
through O
Amazon O
can O
be O
risky O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
check O
reviews O
carefully O
to O
ensure O
the O
vendor O
is O
reputable O
. O

I O
personally O
purchase O
directly O
from O
WholesomeStory O
because O
I O
‚Äôd O
rather O
not O
give O
Amazon O
my O
money O
after O
having O
bad O
experiences O
purchasing O
counterfeit O
cosmetics O
. O

I O
also O
do O
n‚Äôt O
like O
giving O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
mind O
! O

Yeah O
, O
it O
‚Äôs O
really O
high O
efficiency O
and O
I O
think O
the O
change O
was O
mostly O
because O
the O
area O
where O
my O
lesions B-ADR
are O
located O
are O
associated O
with O
an O
increased O
risk O
of O
disability O
and O
we O
just O
wanted O
to O
get O
on O
a O
high O
effective O
treatment O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O

I O
was O
n‚Äôt O
doing O
badly O
on O
Tecfidera B-DRUG
, O
I O
kinda O
liked O
it O
and O
it O
‚Äôs O
admittedly O
a O
little O
bit O
weird O
being O
off O
of O
it O
( O
started O
ocrevus B-DRUG
2 O
weeks O
ago O
) O
. O


I O
love O
that O
it O
‚Äôs O
just O
an O
infusion O
2 O
times O
a O
year O
so O
it O
‚Äôs O
super O
low O
maintenance O
. O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
have O
any O
side O
effects O
from O
it O
. O

I O
only O
feel O
a O
little O
groggy B-ADR
the O
next O
few O
days O
after O
I O
get O
the O
infusion O
. O

I O
love O
it O
because O
it O
really O
worked O
well O
for O
me O
too O
. O

Before O
I O
was O
on O
it O
I O
was O
on O
copaxone B-DRUG
which O
was O
a O
self O
injection O
3 O
times O
a O
week O
and O
I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
like O
that O
. O

And O
copaxone B-DRUG
did O
nothing O
to O
stop O
progression O
for O
me O
so O
I O
had O
a O
really O
bad O
flare B-ADR
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2018 O
and O
my O
mri O
showed O
a O
ton O
of O
new O
lesions B-ADR
. O

My O
neuro O
got O
me O
on O
ocrevus B-DRUG
and O
I O
have O
not O
had O
a O
new O
lesion B-ADR
or O
a O
new O
MS O
symptom O
since O
then O
and O
have O
been O
feeling O
really O
good O
MS O
wise O
. O


It O
‚Äôs O
not O
like O
antibiotics O
where O
it O
makes O
symptoms O
worse O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
most O
medications O
for O
Crohns O
treat O
the O
symptoms O
and O
not O
the O
cause O
. O

Also O
, O
usually O
, O
one O
medication O
will O
only O
work O
for O
a O
period O
of O
time O
, O
and O
then O
you O
have O
to O
try O
something O
new O
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
since O
2013 O
and O
it O
has O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
as O
well O
as O
it O
did O
then O


 O
Just O
keep O
a O
record O
of O
your O
symptoms O
and O
then O
you O
can O
talk O
to O
your O
doctor O
about O
other O
options O
. O

I O
always O
think O
of O
our O
options O
as O
a O
‚Äú O
toolkit O
‚Äù O
. O

You O
need O
to O
know O
what O
‚Äôs O
available O
and O
use O
what O
you O
need O
at O
that O
moment O
in O
time O
. O



 O
Also O
no O
, O
you O
‚Äôre O
not O
going O
to O
need O
to O
prepare O
yourself O
for O
a O
downhill O
life O
. O

Yes O
, O
you O
might O
not O
be O
able O
to O
lead O
the O
same O
exact O
life O

you O
‚Äôll O
be O
ok O

I O
‚Äôm O

supplements O

atorvastatin B-DRUG

I O
get O

My O
cholesterol B-ADR

I O
brought O
it O
down O
to O
normal O

Lipitor B-DRUG
had O
a O
side O

with O
me O
of O
exhaustion B-ADR

so O
I O
've O
since O
moved O
to O
a O
less O
powerful O
statin O

I O
think O
my O
original O
number O
was O
110 O
or O
something O
like O
that O

 O
But O
honestly O
, O
if O
you O
're O

just O
take O

ti O
consiglierei O
di O
sentire O
chi O
ti O
ha O
prescritto O
lo O
  O
Zoloft B-DRUG

This O
is O
probably O
the O
calm O
before O
the O
storm O
. O



 O
My O
first O
cycle O
I O
was O
the O
same O
way O
. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
all O
pretty O
normal O

The O
adrenaline O
from O
having O
cancer O
, O
plus O
absurd O
dosage O
levels O
of O
prednisone B-DRUG
, O
leaves O
you O
restless B-ADR
and O
tired B-ADR
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

which O
for O
me O
after O
months O
and O
months O
becomes O
very O
frustrating O
. O



 O
My O
advice O
would O
be O
to O
focus O
on O
basic O
physical O
comfort O
, O
convenience O
, O
and O
be O
100 O
% O
supportive O
and O
accessible O
, O
but O
do O
n‚Äôt O
helicopter O
. O

Just O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O
brutal O
waiting O
for O
the O
chemo O
drugs O
to O
do O
their O
job O
. O



 O
For O
the O
pill O
thing O
, O
I O
had O
8x O
pill O
carriers O
: O
morning O
/ O
lunch O
/ O
dinner O
/ O
bedtime O
, O
doubled O
for O
a O
second O
week O
. O

The O
spreadsheet O
is O
a O
helpful O
start O
, O
but O
she O
certainly O
can O
not O
rely O
on O
spreadsheets O
after O
the O
chemo O
brain O
kicks O
in O
. O


I O
‚Äôd O
be O
fine O
with O
that O
but O
I O
think O
before O
calibrate O
got O
me O
the O
wegovy B-DRUG
discount O
they O
might O
have O
tried O
ozempric B-DRUG
. O

So O
far O
calibrate O
told O
me O
to O
just O
take O
larger O
doses O
of O
metformin B-DRUG
which O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
want O
to O
do O
. O


Does O
your O
heart O
beat O
feel O
irregular O
? O

Atrial B-ADR
Fibrillation I-ADR
commonly O
causes O
SVT B-ADR
. O

Also O
, O
a O
beta O
blocker O
like O
Propanolol B-DRUG
is O
good O
for O
the O
physical O
symptoms O
of O
anxiety B-ADR
and O
especially O
a O
racing O
heart O
. O

Only O
thing O
is O
that O
your O
bradycardia B-ADR
may O
be O
a O
contradiction O
. O

I O
took O
a O
beta O
blocker O
with O
bradycardia B-ADR
and O
it O
did O
n‚Äôt O
make O
things O
worse O
. O

I O
do O
get O
it O
with O
the O
palpitations B-ADR
. O

They O
are O
especially O
noticeable O
at O
night O
for O
me O
. O

I O
still O
have O
an O
old O
prescription O
of O
metoprolol B-DRUG
and O
will O
take O
it O
when O
I O
‚Äôm O
having O
one O
of O
those O
nights O
. O


Everyone O
is O
dealing O
with O
their O
condition O
in O
different O
ways O
. O

I O
get O
it O
that O
it O
is O
annoying O
when O
lines O
are O
held O
up O
and O
your O
trip O
was O
intended O
to O
be O
quick O
. O

Perhaps O
she O
forgot O
she O
needed O
it O
, O
and O
it O
would O
have O
taken O
WAY O
longer O
to O
get O
there O
and O
back B-ADR
with O
what O
she O
needed O
. O

Maybe O
she O
only O
originally O
went O
to O
the O
store O
for O
a O
cucumber O
and O
needed O
it O
for O
something O
, O
like O
you O
needed O
bok O
choy O
, O
but O
forgot O
it O
until O
that O
moment O
. O

Not O
the O
end O
of O
the O
world O
IMO O
. O



  O
I O
'm O
also O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
and O
it O
certainly O
does O
not O
give O
me O
the O
same O
ability O
to O
walk O
more O
consistently O
like O
you O
report O
, O
so O
I O
am O
envious O
of O
your O
experience O
! O


I O
‚Äôm O
sorry O
you O
‚Äôre O
dealing O
with O
so O
much O
fat O
phobia O
and O
bad O
medical O
care O
from O
doctors O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
so O
common O
but O
still O
awful O
. O



 O
I O
will O
say O
, O
for O
me O
, O
metformin B-DRUG
made O
me O
sick B-ADR
for O
like O
‚Ä¶ O
3 O
months O
but O
now O
is O
fine O
. O

So O
you O
can O
adapt O
if O
you O
feel O
like O
your O
insulin B-ADR
resistance I-ADR
needs O
it O
. O



 O
One O
phrase O
I O
have O
n‚Äôt O
actually O
tried O
myself O
, O
but O
I O
hear O
is O
very O
effective O
is O
‚Äú O
what O
would O
you O
prescribe O
/ O
recommend O
to O
a O
skinny O
person O
with O
this O
condition O
? O

‚Äù O
And O
then O
‚Äú O
I O
‚Äôd O
like O
to O
try O
that O
‚Äù O
. O

If O
they O
say O
no O
, O
then O
‚Äú O
please O
write O
in O
my O
medical O
records O
that O
you O
are O
refusing O
to O
prescribe O
X O
treatment O
. O

‚Äù O
It O
is O
apparently O
often O
quite O
effective O
. O

Also O
declining O
to O
be O
weighed O
I O
hear O
can O
help O
, O
because O
then O
there O
is O
n‚Äôt O
the O
number O
they O
are O
focused O
on O
. O



 O
Also O
, O
I O
think O
Nicola O
Salmon O
‚Äôs O
book O
( O

might O
be O

It O
‚Äôs O
all O
about O
dealing O
with O
fat O
phobia O
when O
doctors O
are O
not O
wanting O
to O
treat O
your O
infertility O
with O
anything O
besides O
weight O
  O
loss O
, O
and O
about O
why O
the O
evidence O
shows O
being O
fat O

pregnant O
is O
not O
excessively O
risky O

that O

Eliquis B-DRUG
and O
I O
'm O
already O
on O
lisinopril B-DRUG
and O
rosuvastatin B-DRUG
. O

  O
I O
'm O
beginning O
to O
wonder O
if O
it O
's O
the O
feeling O
of O
the O
nasal B-ADR
canula I-ADR
on O
my O
face O
that O
is O
causing O
the O
nightmares B-ADR

Ya O
weed O
is O
n't O
for O
everybody O
... O
Seroquel B-DRUG
will O
fuck O
with O
your O
heart O
rate O
a O
lot O
more O
than O
weed O
. O

Beware O
the O
seroquel B-DRUG
munchies O
. O

I O
remember O
the O
orgasmic O
feeling O
of O
finishing O
entire O
packages O
of O
Oreos O
promising O
myself O
I O
'll O
stop O
at O
the O
end O
of O
each O
row O
and O
just O
eating O
everything O
... O


 O
But O
ya O
anybody O
who O
said O
they O
tripped O
on O
Prozac B-DRUG
or O
paxil B-DRUG
or O
Zoloft B-DRUG
or O
other O
ssri O
snri O
drugs O
, O
they O
're O
totally O
full O
of O
shit O
. O

I O
've O
been O
on O
all O
those O
drugs O
and O
tried O
to O
eat O
shrooms O
on O
every O
one O
of O
them O
. O

I O
wasted O
a O
lot O
of O
shrooms O
thinking O
the O
trip O
was O
about O
to O
happen O
and O
feeling O
mildly O
different O
. O

But O
never O
tripping O
. O

It O
was O
a O
bitch O
coming O
off O
of O
those O
meds O
too O
especially O
after O
like O
a O
year O
. O

I O
remember O
these O
brain B-ADR
zap I-ADR
things O
that O
would O
happen O
where O
it O
's O
like O
your O
being O
shocked O
with O
electricity O
at O
random O
times O
for O
no O
reason O
all O
day O
. O

All O
kinds O
of O
uncomfortable O
feelings O
coming O
off O
those O
pills O
. O

Antidepressants O
suck O
ass O

I O
had O
chicken B-ADR
pox I-ADR
as O
a O
kid O
. O

Ocrevus B-DRUG
has O
not O
caused O
me O
any O
breakouts O
of O
any O
kind O
. O

My O
husband O
gets O
cold B-ADR
sores I-ADR
a O
lot O
and O
I O
still O
have O
never O
gotten O
one O
. O

Hope O
this O
helps O

Both O
of O
my O
cats O
have O
been O
on O
prozac B-DRUG
. O



 O
One O
was O
on O
it O
when O
she O
was O
having O
litter O
box O
issues O
- O
no O
side O
effects O
but O
no O
benefit O
either O
. O

Turns O
out O
she O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
litter O
so O
there O
was O
n't O
actually O
anxiety B-ADR
to O
fix O
. O



 O
Other O
one O
has O
been O
on O
it O
for O
over O
a O
year O
due O
to O
compulsive O
overgrooming O
. O

The O
grooming O
is O
an O
allergy B-ADR
thing O
, O
but O
then O
he O
'll O
keep O
doing O
it O
obsessively O
even O
after O
the O
issue O
has O
resolved O
. O

The O
prozac B-DRUG
has O
made O
a O
* O
huge O
* O
difference O
for O
him O
- O
he O
still O
overgrooms O
if O
I O
slack O
on O
giving O
him O
his O
allergy B-ADR
meds O
, O
but O
he O
stops O
now O
and O
his O
fur O
has O
mostly O
grown O
back O
. O

He O
also O
has O
a O
bit O
more O
confidence O
around O
other O
people O
which O
is O
not O
why O
he O
's O
on O
the O
meds O
but O
it O
helps O
- O
previously O
if O
I O
had O
a O
guest O
stay O
with O
me O
for O
three O
days O
he O
'd O
only O
come O
out O
from O
under O
my O
bed O
to O
use O
the O
toilet O
. O

Now O
he O
lurks O
at O
a O
distance O
. O


Omg O
yes O
! O

I O
ve O
used O
Prednisone B-DRUG
for O
1 O
year O
and O
after O
tapering O
I O
became O
very O
depressed B-ADR
and O
anxious B-DRUG
. O

I O
also O
felt O
quite O
good O
on O
steroids O
but O
after O
tapering O
it O
went O
all O
downhill O
. O

 

 O
My O
doc O
told O
me O
it O
could O
n't O
be O
caused O
by O
the O
steroids O
, O
but O
i O
m O
100 O
% O
sure O
it O
was O
the O
cause O
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
that O
experience O
this O
too O
. O

It O
can O
take O
some O
time O
for O
the O
adrenal O
glands O
to O
recover O
fully O
after O
steroids O
. O


Oh O
gosh O
how O
I O
miss O
those O
! O

I O
had O
Lasix B-DRUG
after O
wearing O
transitional O
contacts O
and O
was O
SHOCKED O
at O
how O
bright O
life O
really O
was O
üòÖ O

Took O
them O
for O
a O
year O
. O

And O
that O
s O
difficult O
for O
me O
to O
answer O
because O
I O
was O
also O
using O
antidepressants O
at O
the O
time O
and O
they O
stopped O
working O
when O
I O
stopped O
prednisone B-DRUG
. O

But O
it O
took O
a O
long O
time O
before O
I O
felt O
better O
, O
at O
least O
half O
a O
year O
I O
think O
. O

If O
you O
keep O
having O
your O
symptoms O
you O
should O
talk O
to O
a O
doctor O
about O
it O
. O


how O
can O
i O
safe O
drink O
or O
smoke O
weed O
when O
i O
m O
on O
zoloft B-DRUG
, O
should O
i O
skip O
for O
few O
days O
or O
should O
not O
? O


I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
cardiomegaly B-ADR

cardiomyopathy B-ADR
with O
an O
ef O

Cheers O

I O
do O
think O
my O
tolerance O
is O
lower O
but O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
blackout O
however O
I O
hear O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
do O
. O

For O
me O
it O
‚Äôs O
weird O
as O
after O
taking O
Zoloft B-DRUG
for O
a O
while O
my O
hangovers O
are O
a O
lot O
better O
mentally O
and O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
get O
one O
at O
all O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
understand O
it O

I O
mean O
, O
how O
often O
are O
people O
referred O
to O
the O
ER O
for O
hypertensive B-ADR
" O
" O
" O
urgency O
" O
" O
" O
that O
are O
asymptomatic O
that O
just O
need O
to O
start O
taking O
their O
lisinopril B-DRUG
? O


I O
guess O
a O
few O
things O
helped O
it O
get O
easier O


 O
1 O
. O

My O
bloating B-ADR
was O
terrible O
so O
I O
asked O
for O
a O
Lasix B-DRUG
( O
I O
think O
that O
is O
what O
its O
called O
) O
to O
help O
me O
urinate B-ADR
more I-ADR
often I-ADR
and O
pass O
the O
liquid O
. O

That O
seemed O
to O
help O
a O
lot O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
you O
have O
that O
or O
not O

2 O
. O

I O
drank O
water O
anytime O
I O
could O
and O
ate O
whatever O
I O
could O
find O
. O

Eating O
helped O
with O
the O
nausea B-ADR
for O
me O
. O

Also O
with O
nausea B-ADR
I O
was O
taking O
the O
nausea B-ADR
pills O
in O
advance O
of O
when O
I O
would O
expect O
to O
feel O
bad O
. O

I O
guess O
this O
helped O
combat O
it O
a O
bit O
. O

Calories O
were O
huge O
. O

I O
would O
eat O
a O
750 O
calorie O
breakfast O
each O
morning O
before O
chemo O
. O

I O
hated O
the O
hospital O
food O
and O
it O
was O
one O
thing O
I O
felt O
I O
could O
control O
. O


3 O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
expect O
it O
, O
but O
the O
body O
should O
get O
used O
to O
it O
in O
a O
sense O
. O

First O
round O
your O
body O
is O
like O
" O
what O
the O
fuck O
is O
going O
on O
! O

? O

" O
. O

I O
think O
mine O
adapted O
and O
knew O
what O
to O
expect O
. O


4 O
. O

Going O
for O
a O
walk O
or O
exercising O
a O
little O
bit O
. O


5 O
. O

This O
sounds O
cheesy O
but O
just O
enjoying O
the O
days O
you O
have O
off O
. O

Trying O
not O
to O
think O
about O
going O
back O
. O



 O
That O
s O
all O
I O
can O
think O
of O
right O
now O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
any O
other O
questions O
down O
the O
line O
, O
let O
me O
know O
! O


It O
is O
possibly O
a O
side O
effect O
but O
different O
people O
with O
different O
bodies O
, O
I O
‚Äôm O
on O
both O
amlodipine B-DRUG

mg O
and O
not O
feeling O
any O
of O
the O
pains B-ADR
so O
far O
so O
yeah O
it O
could O
be O
a O
side O
effect O

no O

added O

no O

it O

going O

anything O

going O
to O
try O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
and O
see O
. O

Also O
started O
baby O
aspirin O
which O
is O
supposed O
to O
help O
as O
well O
. O

Mostly O
I O
keep O
hearing O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
treating O
symptoms O

time O
for O
things O
to O
heal O

Type O
2 O
diabetes O
does O
n't O
usually O
require O
insulin O
, O
but O
raher O
oral O
antidiabetiscs O
( O
like O
metformin B-DRUG
) O
. O

Type O
one O
requires O
insulin O
from O
the O
beginning O
, O
which O
is O
even O
wore O
, O
because O
that O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
diabetes O
that O
you O
gen O
when O
young O
. O


Everybody O
responds O
differently O
to O
different O
medications O
, O
but O
personally O
I O
feel O
like O
Prozac B-DRUG
has O
really O
helped O
with O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
( O
diagnosed O
with O
GAD B-ADR
for O
years O
) O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
‚Äôm O
still O
adjusting O
to O
the O
new O
( O
more O
like O
old O
) O
me O
, O
I O
‚Äôve O
noticed O
that O
I O
‚Äôm O
able O
to O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
that O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
blocked O
me O
from O
previously O
. O

Depression B-ADR
has O
never O
really O
been O
an O
issue O
. O

It O
took O
over O
a O
month O
though O
and O
I O
‚Äôm O
still O
dealing O
with O
side O
effects O
from O
my O
changing O
doses O
. O


So O
your O
first O
dmt O
was O
tysabri B-DRUG
? O

Then O
rituxan B-DRUG
for O
a O
year O
? O

And O
then O
ocrevus B-DRUG
? O


Exactly O
the O
same O
for O
me O
. O

  O
While O
propranolol B-DRUG
does O
help O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
, O
the O
ONLY O
thing O
that O
really O
helps O
for O
moments O
of O
higher O
anxiety B-ADR
or O
panic B-ADR
is O
Clonozepam B-DRUG
( O
diazepam B-DRUG
does O
n't O
even O
cut O
it O
for O
me O
) O
. O

  O
I O
have O
tried O
EVERY O
other O
benzo O
, O
every O
SSRI O
and O
every O
non O
- O
sedating O
med O
out O
there O
, O
but O
it O
's O
just O
Clonozepam B-DRUG
fr O
some O
reason O
. O

  O
I O
spent O
many O
years O
too O
anxious B-ADR
to O
accept O
it O
, O
because O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
addiction B-ADR
potential O
with O
clonozepam B-DRUG
gave O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
in O
itself O
lol O
! O

! O

  O
But O
in O
the O
end O
, O
after O
many O
years O
, O
I O
take O
a O
long O
term O
low O
dose O
of O
Clon B-DRUG
. O

and O
try O
to O
keep O
it O
on O
a O
" O
when O
needed O
only O
" O
basis O
( O
when O
it O
's O
mild- O
medium O
anxiety B-ADR
I O
try O
and O
suffer O
through O
it O
with O
propanolol O
or O
just O
certain O
relaxing O
activities O
. O

  O
I O
trust O
myself O
not O
to O
get O
too O
addicted B-ADR
to O
it O
, O
but O
have O
accepted O
that O
it O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
long O
term O
solution O
. O

I O
also O
try O
and O
take O
chunks O
of O
time O
( O
like O
one O
week O
chunks O
) O
where O
I O
sometimes O
do O
n't O
use O
it O
, O
just O
so O
my O
body O
does O
n't O
get O
too O
hooked O
and O
my O
dosage O
needs O
to O
go O
up O

 O
That O
said O
, O
I O
've O
been O
taking O
Clonozepam B-DRUG

this O
for O
the O
last O
ten O
years O
( O
so O
, O
I O
would O
say O
on O
average O
, O
I O
take O
between O
.5 O
and O
2 O
mg O
at O
a O
time O
( O
once O
a O
day O
only O
and O
depending O
on O
how O
strong O
the O
anxiety B-ADR
is O
) O
, O
aproximately O
4 O
- O
5 O
times O
a O

on O
average O
, O
with O
maybe O
a O

for O

I O
‚Äôve O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
‚Äôs O
it O
‚Äôs O

it O
makes O
you O
actually O

I O

I O
currently O
take O

I O
had O
been O

up O

my O
Kidney O
doctor O
said O
was O
impossible O
since O
I O
have O
physical O
changes O
. O

I O
think O
it O
‚Äôs O
due O
to O
better O
hydration O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
been O
at O

A O

found O
furosemide B-DRUG

The O

nearly O

As O

I O
ca O

really O
even O

how O
I O

afraid O

you O

I O

the O

escalated O
the O

 O

off O

in O

 O
The O
feeling O

just O
a O

it O

There O
are O
so O
many O
things O
in O

that O
render O
these O
safety O

useless O

even O

 O
I O
am O
not O
excusing O
what O

it O
is O
not O
a O

can O
say O

we O

field O
where O
nurses O
are O
already O
blamed O
first O
, O
what O
more O
will O
fall O
on O
our O
heads O
? O


Anyone O
want O
to O
start O
a O
gofundme O
to O
help O
the O
refs O
get O
Lasix B-DRUG
  O
so O
they O
can O
maybe O
see O
those O
penalties O
? O


Its O
pretty O
rampant O
here O
, O
too O
, O
but O
your O
exposure O
depends O
on O
which O
part O
of O
town O
you O
work O
in O
. O

It O
's O
weird O
, O
though O
, O
I O
can O
tolerate O
the O
early O
refill O
on O
the O
opiate O
crowd O
more O
than O
I O
can O
the O
" O
I O
'll O
DIE O
without O
my O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
" O
crowd O
. O

Not O
sure O
why O
. O


Yes O
. O

Take O
benadryl B-DRUG
if O
you O
can O
. O

Call O
the O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
compass O
program O
. O

I O
get O
the O
rash B-ADR
and O
then O
tightening O
in O
my O
throat O
. O


How O

My O
doctor O
wants O
6 O
more O
months O
before O
he O
would O
increase O
it O
. O

Been O
on O

2 O
years O
. O

My O

No O

   O
My O
resting O
was O
like O
58 O
, O
sometimes O
lower O
. O

  O
Bupropion B-DRUG
raised O
it O
to O
about O
62 O
, O
maybe O
more O
on O
300 O
mg O
, O
I O
was O
n't O
on O
it O
long O
. O

  O
I O
think O
I O
'm O
stopping O
bup B-DRUG
but O
I O
'll O
ask O
my O
doc O
about O
propanolol B-DRUG

What O
was O
your O
blood O
pressure O
before O
after O
after O
the O
propanolol B-DRUG
? O


Ativan B-DRUG
, O
not O
a O
rabies B-ADR
shot O
. O



 O
I O
do O
n't O
love O
the O
idea O
of O
benzos B-DRUG
but O
you O
can O
go O
to O
the O
hospital O
for O
the O
anxiety B-ADR
. O

It O
sounds O
like O
you O
're O
in O
a O
bad O
state O
of O
panic B-ADR
. O



 O
If O
your O
blood B-ADR
pressure I-ADR
is I-ADR
high I-ADR
with O
it O
and O
your O
HR O
elevated O
, O
they O
will O
give O
you O
meds O
to O
chill O
you O
out O
. O

Likely O
either O
Ativan B-DRUG
or O
maybe O
Propanolol B-DRUG
. O



 O
If O
you O
hate O
that O
idea O
, O
what O
works O
for O
my O
rising O
panic B-ADR
is O
L B-DRUG
- I-DRUG
theanine I-DRUG
, O
though O
it O
has O
mixed O
results O
. O

Helps O
some O
, O
others O
does O
fuckall O
. O



 O
NAD O
, O
just O
been O
dx'd O
with O
panic B-ADR
disorder I-ADR
for O
24 O
years O
. O


Yes O
it O
is O
true O
. O

They O
have O
similar O
programs O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Stelera B-DRUG
I O
have O
used O
for O
years O
. O

Your O
insurance O
will O
pay O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
cost O
and O
what O
is O
left O
over O
in O
your O
copay O
will O
be O
picked O
up O
on O
the O
discount O
card O
that O
will O
be O
issued O
by O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
. O

The O
amount O
of O
discount O
per O
year O
depends O
, O
but O
it O
is O
typically O
10 O
- O
20k O
. O


Ocrevus B-DRUG
only O
targets O
the O
B O
cells O
so O
the O
large O
majority O
of O
your O
immune O
system O
is O
untouched O
. O

It O
might O
affect O
your O
ability O
to O
make O
antibodies O
but O
that O
wo O
n't O
really O
keep O
you O
from O
getting O
colds O
or O
other O
infections B-ADR
, O
it O
just O
aids O
your O
body O
in O
dealing O
with O
them O
faster O
. O



 O
You O
treat O
infections B-ADR
and O
colds O
just O
like O
any O
other O
way O
, O
use O
otc O
things O
if O
needed O
or O
go O
see O
a O
doctor O
for O
antibiotics O
if O
needed O
. O

I O
usually O
take O
some O
night O
time O
stuff O
to O
help O
me O
sleep O
and O
deal O
with O
the O
  O
cold O
symptoms O
. O

Usually O
done O
and O
over O
with O
them O
all O
after O
a O
week O
, O
just O
like O
normal O
. O


I O
was O
on O
40 O
mg O
Prozac B-DRUG
( O
Fluoxetine B-DRUG
) O
for O
5 O
yrs O
. O

and O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
get O
on O
meds O
after O
being O
off O
them O
for O
a O
year O
& O
a O
half O
, O
they O
put O
me O
back O
on O
Prozac B-DRUG
and O
it O
did O
n‚Äôt O
do O
anything O
but O
make O
me O
sick B-ADR
. O

They O
put O
me O
on O
10 O
mg O
of O
Lexapro B-DRUG
and O
that O
‚Äôs O
worked O
great O
for O
almost O
2 O
years O
now O
! O

Which O
is O
crazy O
bc O
never O
in O
my O
almost O
9 O
yrs O
of O
my O
mental O
health O
journey O
, O
has O
such O
a O
low O
dose O
of O
an O
antidepressant O
worked O
so O
well O
for O
so O
long O
with O
0 O
side O
effects O
( O
no O
change O
in O
libido O
, O
no O
weight B-ADR
gain I-ADR
, O
nothing O
) O
! O

Just O
a O
suggestion O
! O

But O
also O
it O
is O
a O
* O
very O
* O
big O
possibility O
that O
you O
could O
‚Äôve O
been O
experiencing O
serotonin B-ADR
syndrome I-ADR
, O
lots O
of O
things O
could O
bring O
that O
on O
( O
even O
just O
simple O
cold O
meds O
) O
but O
I O
‚Äôd O
imagine O
that O
much O
Adderall O
could O
definitely O
do O
it O
too O
. O

I O
wish O
you O
could O
find O
a O
better O
doctor O
, O
but O
for O
now O
maybe O
ask O
if O
she O
could O
bump O
you O
down O
a O
bit O
? O


So O
I O
have O
it O
based O
on O
genetic O
means O
aka O
idiopathic O
. O

I O
know O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
but O
it O
's O
how O
neuros O
define O
it O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
respond O
to O
any O
of O
the O
meds O
that O
well O
. O

Only O
one O
I O
did O
respond O
to O
was O
lasix B-DRUG
. O

I O
was O
going O
blind O
and O
things O
were O
getting O
worse O
. O

I O
had O
my O
VP O
shunt O
and O
stent O
placed O
last O
year O
and O
have O
been O
in O
remission O
since O
. O

Honestly O
a O
shunt O
might O
be O
your O
only O
option O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
respond O
to O
lasix B-DRUG
. O

I O
was O
an O
athlete O
majority O
of O
my O
life O
so O
when O
I O
started O
gaining B-ADR
weight I-ADR
out O
of O
nowhere O
it O
did O
freak O
me O
out O
and O
concern O
me O
greatly O
. O

This O
disease O
is O
n't O
picky O
. O

It O
chooses O
who O
it O
wants O
based O
off O
pure O
chaos O
. O

I O
'm O
discovering O
that O
IIH O
might O
not O
be O
as O
rare O
as O
we O
are O
told O
it O
is O
. O

With O
so O
many O
people O
having O
similar O
symptoms O
and O
being O
dismissed O
by O
the O
medical O
system O
I O
would O
n't O
be O
surprised O
if O
it O
moves O
up O
to O
uncommon O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
IIH O
is O
strictly O
a O
woman O
's O
disease O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
one O
that O
can O
be O
caused O
by O
so O
many O
variants O
that O
we O
still O
do O
n't O
know O
. O


Just O
take O
a O
breather O
and O
try O
to O
calm O
down O
. O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
therapist O
to O
help O
you O
cope O
. O

It O
's O
saved O
me O
a O
lot O
, O
especially O
having O
a O
therapist O
that O
's O
disabled O
too O
. O

Having O
someone O
help O
guide O
you O
through O
some O
of O
the O
hardest O
points O
in O
your O
life O
can O
be O
a O
literal O
life O
saver O
. O

If O
you O
need O
any O
resources O
to O
find O
one O
that O
does O
n't O
cost O
an O
arm O
and O
a O
leg O
, O
let O
me O
know O
and O
I O
can O
help O
you O
out O
. O


Talk O
to O
your O
doctor O
about O
propanolol B-DRUG
, O
and O
take O
a O
pill O
as O
a O
test O
before O
using O
it O
on O
interview O
day O
. O


Not O
to O
give O
false O
hope O
, O
just O
another O
perspective O
: O
my O
dog O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
congestive B-ADR
heart I-ADR
failure I-ADR
at O
9yrs O
old O
after O
a O
lifelong O
heart B-ADR
murmur I-ADR
, O
and O
the O
vet O
said O
she O
was O
not O
gon O
na O
last O
another O
3 O
months O
at O
the O
rate O
she O
was O
going O
. O



 O
We O
started O
her O
on O
heart O
meds O
, O
Lasix B-DRUG
( O
to O
help O
reduce O
fluid O
on O
the O
heart O
) O
, O
and O
later O
some O
blood O
pressure B-ADR
meds O
when O
needed O
- O
and O
she O
made O
a O
huge O
turn O
around O
! O

She O
lost O
her O
excess O
weight O
and O
lived O
with O
a O
great O
quality O
of O
life O
for O
2 O
more O
years O
until O
she O
was O
11.5yrs O
old O
. O

She O
could O
even O
go O
on O
walks O
, O
just O
not O
anything O
super O
long O
that O
would O
strain O
her O
. O

She O
passed O
away O
from O
unexpected O
fast O
- O
growing O
cancer B-ADR
, O
not O
even O
her O
heart B-ADR
failure I-ADR
! O



 O
If O
you O
have O
a O
good O
vet O
, O
and O
it O
‚Äôs O
closely O
managed O
, O
some O
dogs O
with O
that O
diagnosis O
can O
still O
live O
for O
a O
good O
while O
with O
high O
quality O
of O
life O
. O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
know O
your O
pupper O
‚Äôs O
situation O
, O
but O
it O
may O
not O
be O
at O
the O
level O
of O
euthanasia O
yet O
! O

We O
just O
made O
sure O
to O
take O
lots O
of O
photos O
and O
videos O
, O
and O
enjoy O
every O
minute O
with O
our O
best O
girl O
, O
because O
we O
never O
knew O
how O
long O
it O
would O
last O
. O

I O
will O
say O
some O
prayers O
for O
your O
pup O
. O

* O
hugs O
* O

I O
've O
had O
a O
crohn O
's O
diagnosis O
since O
I O
was O
16 O
( O
20 O
years O
ago O
) O
. O

Different O
condition O
but O
the O
treatments O
can O
be O
the O
same O
. O

I O
take O
humira B-DRUG
and O
a O
maintenance O
dose O
of O
methotrexate B-DRUG
. O

Some O
thoughts O
from O
me O
about O
the O
methotrexate B-DRUG
: O


 O
* O
make O
sure O
to O
ask O
your O
doc O
if O
they O
did O
n't O
already O
recommend O
folic B-DRUG
acid I-DRUG
. O

It O
can O
help O
to O
lessen O
the O
side O
effects O
of O
the O
methotrexate B-DRUG
. O


* O
the O
science O
on O
alcohol O
and O
methotrexate B-DRUG
seems O
mixed O
from O
my O
readings O
. O

The O
recommendations O
I O
found O
said O
that O
there O
was O
increased O
risk O
of O
liver B-ADR
toxicity I-ADR
in O
people O
who O
chronically O
drank O
more O
than O
the O
recommended O
amount O
. O

I O
try O
to O
keep O
my O
drinks O
to O
1 O
or O
2 O
a O
night O
when O
i O
do O
drink O
, O
and O
i O
try O
to O
take O
days O
off O
from O
drinking O
a O
few O
times O
a O
week O
. O


* O
I O
did O
crossfit O
4x O
a O
week O
for O
many O
years O
, O
and O
I O
continue O
to O
lift O
5 O
+ O
days O
a O
week O
with O
a O
full O
time O
job O
that O
i O
consider O
at O
least O
mentally O
demanding O
, O
a O
toddler O
, O
and O
a O
very O
big O
property O
. O

Your O
side O
effects O
might O
change O
depending O
on O
your O
dosage O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
physiology O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
why O
you O
could O
n't O
maintain O
a O
rigorous O
lifting O
schedule O
. O

I O
also O
find O
it O
helpful O
to O
do O
more O
short O
sessions O
per O
week O
vs. O
2 O
- O
3 O
big O
sessions O
. O

This O
seems O
to O
help O
me O
keep O
things O
limber O
. O


* O
I O
personally O
feel O
best O
when O
I O
keep O
eating O
throughout O
the O
day O
. O

Large O
meals O
seem O
to O
aggravate O
inflammation B-ADR
for O
my O
condition O
, O
but O
it O
might O
be O
different O
from O
RA O
. O

I O
've O
heard O
that O
fasting O
has O
benefits O
for O
inflammation B-ADR
, O
but O
I O
find O
it O
hard O
to O
be O
in O
a O
" O
gain O
" O
mindset O
and O
cram O
all O
your O
meals O
into O
a O
smallish O
period O
of O
time O
. O

I O
hate O
keeping O
a O
food O
journal O
, O
but O
it O
can O
be O
very O
helpful O
initially O
for O
remembering O
what O
you O
ate O
the O
previous O
day O
if O
you O
wake O
up O
feeling B-ADR
bad I-ADR
. O


* O
I O
generally O
shoot O
for O
8 O
hours O
of O
sleep O
a O
night O
. O

If O
I O
get O
six O
every O
now O
and O
then O
I O
'm O
usually O
okay O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
might O
be O
the O
answer O
. O

I O
've O
been O
rolling O
this O
idea O
in O
my O
head O
too O
. O

It O
's O
hiking O
season O
. O

So O
I O
've O
got O
the O
bug O
too O
. O


Okay O
let O
‚Äôs O
break O
this O
down O
and O
please O
be O
open O
to O
what O
I O
am O
going O
to O
say O
because O
you O
might O
not O
like O
it O
. O



 O
1-‚ÄúI O
overate O
again O
‚Äù O
, O
this O
mean O
this O
is O
a O
recurring O
issue O
so O
it O
might O
be O
related O
to O
a O
psychiatric O
disease O
such O
as O
bulimia B-ADR
, O
just O
simple O
anxiety B-ADR
or O
depression B-ADR
, O
which O
can O
happen O
in O
different O
ways O
, O
so O
first O
thing O
I O
would O
suggest O
is O
to O
visit O
a O
psychiatrist O
and O
to O
see O
if O
you O
might O
benefit O
from O
therapy O
, O
and O
as O
someone O
who O
struggled O
to O
go O
to O
therapy O
because O
I O
felt O
embarrassed O
( O
it O
was O
a O
different O
issue O
) O
I O
find O
that O
most O
people O
who O
therapy O
as O
a O
solution O
cross O
their O
minds O
deserve O
to O
go O
for O
at O
least O
a O
couple O
sessions O


 O
2 O
- O
You O
are O
valuing O
your O
self O
by O
using O
weight O
which O
is O
100 O
% O
wrong O
! O

, O
the O
goal O
of O
losing O
weight O
is O
to O
be O
as O
healthy O
as O
you O
possibly O
can O
not O
to O
change O
a O
number O
, O
so O
you O
might O
be O
the O
kind O
of O
person O
who O
should O
not O
measure O
their O
weight O
daily O
and O
make O
it O
monthly O
instead O


 O
3-‚ÄúI O
noticed O
acanthosis B-ADR
nigricans I-ADR
‚Äù O
. O

This O
is O
another O
reason O
to O
go O
for O
a O
physician O
, O
a O
good O
GP O
is O
enough O
, O
get O
some O
labs O
done O
to O
exclude O
diabetes B-ADR


 O
4 O
- O
It O
is O
fine O
to O
consider O
pharmacotherapy O
, O
if O
you O
have O
anxiety B-ADR
Bupropion B-DRUG
can O
help O
you O
lose B-ADR
weight I-ADR
while O
managing O
your O
anxiety B-ADR
with O
a O
combination O
of O
therapy O
, O
dieting O
and O
daily O
workout O
. O

Metformin B-DRUG
as O
a O
management O
of O
Diabetes O
can O
help O
you O
also O
weight O
and O
some O
physicians O
also O
use O
it O
in O
Pre O
- O
diabetes O
. O


And O
whatever O
you O
heard O
about O
it O
do O
not O
knock O
out O
sleeve O
surgery O
from O
your O
mind O
, O
keep O
it O
there O


 O
5- O
Again O
weight O
is O
a O
number O
, O
but O
if O
your O
still O
want O
to O
measure O
it O
get O
other O
numbers O
too O
, O
measure O
your O
waist O
, O
thighs O
and O
arms O
. O

You O
might O
be O
losing O
water O
or O
fat O
and O
gaining O
some O
muscle O
especially O
if O
you O
have O
tried O
to O
do O
more O
resistance O
training O
lately O


 O
I O
said O
you O
might O
hate O
me O
at O
the O
start O
because O
people O
will O
not O
think O
of O
outside O
help O
from O
a O
certified O
Dietetion O
, O
pharmacotherapy O
or O
surgery O
, O
but O
you O
should O
keep O
them O
in O
mind O
especially O
if O
your O
goal O
is O
your O
health O


 O
To O
sum O
up O
: O
go O
to O
psychiatrist O
, O
GP O
, O
do O
not O
look O
at O
your O
weight O
daily O
look O
at O
how O
you O
feel O
instead O
, O
check O

, O
keep O
in O

other O
ways O

 O

I O
did O
n‚Äôt O

used O

this O

I O
just O
asked O
my O
doctor O
if O
I O
could O
have O
it O
because O
I O
was O
getting O
those O
morning O

causing O
adrenaline B-ADR
rushes I-ADR
as O
soon O
as O
I O
woke O
up O

I O
figured O
Propanolol B-DRUG
would O
be O
good O
for O
blocking O
the O
adrenaline O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
know O
if O
it O
was O

if O
it O
was O
the O
propanolol B-DRUG

they O
seemed O
to O
really O
make O
the O

easier O

I O
took O
them O
every O

 O
The O
thing O
that O
I O
have O
noticed O
with O
Gabapentin B-DRUG
is O
that O
it O
takes O
a O
fairly O
long O
time O
to O
actually O
work O
for O
my O
nerve B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

It O
'll O
take O
at O
least O
a O
few O
days O
or O
a O
week O
taking O
it O
at O
my O
intended O
dose O
before O
I O
get O
any O
noticeable O
reduction O
. O

The O
other O
side O
effects O
I O
get O
are O
cognitive B-ADR
difficulties I-ADR
, O
headaches B-ADR
and O
when O
starting O
/ O
coming O
off O
of O
gaba O
I O
'll O
be O
extremely O
fatigued B-ADR
( O
similar O
to O
adrenal O
burnout O
) O
. O

I O
cycle O
it O
on O
and O
off O
through O
periods O
of O
nerve B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
when O
I O
need O
to O
sleep O
but O
if O
you O
're O
taking O
it O
for O
anxiety B-ADR
I O
'd O
say O
stick O
to O
your O
dose O
and O
see O
how O
it O
feels O
after O
a O
week O
or O
two O
. O

   
 O
If O
you O
are O
n't O
noticing O
any O
improvement O
speak O
to O
your O
GP O
and O
they O
'll O
probably O
increase O
your O
dose O
to O
somewhere O
around O
900 O
mg O
per O
day O
. O

If O
you O
were O
on O
propanolol B-DRUG
previously O
for O
anxiety B-ADR
I O
'd O
say O
to O
try O
it O
again O
if O
it O
is O
n't O
causing O
you O
any O
issues O
; O
to O
my O
knowledge O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
any O
long O
term O
side O
effects O
and O
I O
use O
it O
for O
going O
out O
and O
going O
to O
sleep O
with O
gabapentin B-DRUG
without O
issues O

My O
doctor O
recommended O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
because O
he O
had O
some O
people O
try O
Kesimpta B-DRUG
and O
not O
follow O
through O
because O
of O
fear O
of O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O

I O
would O
have O
minded O
the O

three O

very O

Dr. O

let O
me O
suffer O
for O
2 O
years O
before O
sending O
my O
to O
a O
nephrologist O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
stage O
3 O
kidney B-ADR
failure I-ADR
due O
to O
chronic O
high B-ADR
blood I-ADR
pressure I-ADR
and O
have O
to O
take O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
everyday O

That O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
my O

as O
well O
. O


No O

I O
just O
love O
that O
he O
mentioned O
shingles B-ADR
! O

I O
got O
surprised O
by O
it O
after O
I O
started O
Rituxan B-DRUG
years O
ago O
in O
my O
30s O
. O

My O
neuro O
( O
otherwise O
very O
lovely O
and O
capable O
) O
acted O
a O
bit O
like O
I O
was O
weird O
for O
having O
it O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
showed O
her O
! O

I O
've O
actually O
had O
at O
least O
3 O
flare B-ADR
ups I-ADR
of O
it O
, O
over O
the O
years O
( O
5 O
years O
on O
Rituxan B-DRUG
, O
2 O
+ O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
) O
, O
most O
recently O
after O
COVID O
shots O
2 O
and O
3 O
üòÇ O


 O
FWIW O
, O
when O
I O
get O
shingles B-ADR
, O
it O
's O
not O
textbook O
aka O
never O
around O
my O
back O
/ O
waistline O
. O

The O
first O
time O
was O
a O
patch O
on O
my O
forearm O
about O
2 O
- O
3 O
" O
across O
, O
very O
dense O
. O

The O
other O
times O
it O
's O
more O
like O
chicken B-ADR
pox I-ADR
-- O
little O
bits O
spread O
out O
from O
head O
to O
toe O
. O



 O
Mostly O
they O
itch B-ADR
instead O
of O
hurt B-ADR
, O
but O
I O
still O
like O
to O
take O
a O
--vir O
because O
the O
internal O
flare B-ADR
is O
pretty O
unpleasant O
for O
about O
a O
week O
( O
extra O
bad O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
upset B-ADR
stomach I-ADR
, O
etc O
) O
and O
I O
DO O
fear O
the O
possibility O
of O
any O
more O
lasting O
nerve B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

So O
far O
, O
so O
good O
on O
that O
count O
! O



 O
Wish O
you O
all O
the O
best O
! O


look O
up O

. O

think O
prozac B-DRUG
is O
one O
, O
which O
may O
block O

I O

I O
too O
was O
afraid O

I O
considered O

better O

that O
for O
most O
people O
trying O

find O
the O
right O
SSRI O
for O
yourself O

usually O
takes O
a O

medications O

see O
which O
one O
works O
for O
you O

For O
me O
personally O
Prozac B-DRUG
really O
helps O
my O
anxiety B-ADR

adderall B-DRUG
was O
added O
shortly O
after O

my O
adhd B-ADR

work O

a O
little O

it O

almost O
no O

n't O

you O

Zestril B-DRUG
just O
for O
the O
sake O
of O

it O

And O
sadly O
, O
on O
the O
flip O
side O
, O
if O
it O
's O

not O

basically O
no O

I O
do O
n't O
think O

will O
tell O
you O
that O
either O

there O
are O
still O

his O

I O

 O
He O
's O
Canadian O

but O
the O
general O
approach O
is O
unchanged O
for O
you O
Yanks O
. O

It O
's O
not O
just O
about O
" O
rent O
cost O
vs O
mortgage O
cost O
" O
. O

People O
sometimes O
ignore O
property O
tax O
, O
maintenance O
costs O
, O
realtor O
fees O
, O
and O
time O
costs O
. O

People O
very O
often O
forget O
the O
opportunity O
cost O
of O
not O
investing O
. O

The O
math O
is O
not O
so O
simple O
. O

You O
have O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
you O
are O
most O
likely O
to O
return O
if O
you O
instead O
invest O
what O
you O
would O
have O
used O
as O
a O
downpayment O
and O
any O
difference O
between O
rent O
vs O
mortgage O
and O
housing O
costs O
. O

You O
have O
to O
assume O
you O
use O
whatever O
tax O
vehicles O
/ O
programs O
are O
available O
to O
you O
in O
either O
approach O
. O

You O
have O
to O
consider O
your O
own O
behaviours O
and O
discipline O
, O
debt O
tolerance O
, O
and O
credit O
access O
. O

You O
have O
to O
consider O
the O
rental O
vs O
property O
market O
in O
your O
destination O
including O
how O
much O
equity O
may O
increase O
( O
not O
really O
precictable O
) O
and O
any O
rent O
control O
laws O
. O

You O
have O
to O
consider O
if O
you O
are O
likely O
to O
move O
, O
especially O
if O
your O
relationship O
status O
were O
to O
change O

dose O
sometimes O
. O



 O
It O
is O
entirely O
reasonable O
to O
rent O
. O

Your O
requirements O
are O
reasonable O
. O

Do O
n't O
get O
a O
roommate O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
unless O
finances O
prevent O
you O
living O
on O
your O
own O
. O



 O
I O
went O
the O
rent O
route O
when O
I O
first O
started O
, O
and O
it O
has O
worked O
very O
well O
for O
me O
. O

I O
needed O
a O
close O
location O
, O
the O
flexibility O
to O
move O
if O
I O
wanted O
, O
and O
minimal O
time O
investments O
or O
maintenance O
responsibilities O
. O

Legally O
, O
my O
rent O
can O
not O
increase O
more O
than O
1.2 O
% O
this O
year O
. O

It O
was O
frozen O
during O
covid O
. O

Given O
longer O
residencies O
, O
rent O
control O
laws O
become O
important O
if O
you O
can O
find O
a O
great O
arrangement O
. O



 O
At O
the O
end O
of O
seven O
years O
, O
if O
all O
continues O
as O
forecasted O
, O
I O
will O
very O
slightly O
out O
earn O
my O
colleague O
who O
purchased O
a O
home O
and O
put O
down O
~150k O
. O

But O
some O
also O
like O
home O
ownership O
, O
as O
it O
is O
somewhat O
forced O
investment O
. O


The O
only O
way O
to O
get O
over O
stage O
fright O
is O
experience O
, O
which O
in O
itself O
is O
a O
double O
- O
edged O
sword O
. O

The O
best O
way O
I O
approach O
it O
is O
to O
realize O
that O
everyone O
messes O
up O
- O
even O
the O
pros O
. O

It O
's O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
moving O
on O
when O
you O
make O
a O
mistake O
and O
not O
drawing O
attention O
to O
it O
. O

Hell O
I O
saw O
Tool O
  O
perform O
live O
recently O
and O
it O
was O
n't O
perfect O
, O
but O
nevertheless O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O



 O
However O
... O
we O
are O
in O
a O
world O
where O
everyone O
's O
anxiety B-ADR
has O
been O
maxed O
out O
, O
so O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
this O
is O
only O
happening O
to O
you O
. O

Musicians O
often O
turn O
to O
alcohol O
and O
recreational O
drugs O
to O
counter O
stage O
fright O
which O
can O
be O
fine O
in O
moderation O
but O
its O
easy O
for O
that O
stuff O
to O
get O
out O
of O
hand O
. O

One O
thing O
you O
could O
consider O
is O
something O
like O
a O
beta O
blocker O
for O
when O
you O
have O
to O
perform O
. O

College O
students O
have O
used O
prescription O
drugs O
in O
this O
arena O
like O
Propanolol B-DRUG
for O
decades O
during O
stressful O
times O
like O
finals O
. O

Your O
doctor O
/ O
physician O
can O
likely O
talk O
about O
options O
, O
but O
anxiety B-ADR
meds O
can O
be O
abused O
just O
like O
other O
drugs O
so O
you O
need O
to O
approach O
it O
with O
caution O
and O
knowledge O
. O



 O
Hope O
this O
helps O
. O


Just O
started O
prozac B-DRUG
. O

I O
have O
n't O
experienced O
any O
cravings O
/ O
hunger O
because O
my O
appetite O
's O
been O
suppressed O
by O
anxiety B-ADR
for O
so O
long O
. O

 
  O
Honestly O
, O
I O
myself O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
SSRIs O
cause O
increased B-ADR
appetite I-ADR
, O
but O
you O
wo O
n't O
gain B-ADR
weight I-ADR
unless O
you O
eat O
more O
. O

Some O
people O
say O
there O
're O
ways O
to O
make O
distinctions O
between O
false O
hunger B-ADR
signals O
and O
real O
ones O
, O
so O
if O
the O
cravings O
do O
persist O
I O
'm O
sure O
there O
's O
a O
way O
to O
deal O
with O
them O
in O
terms O
of O
life O
style O

I O
called O
my O
doctor O
Friday O
because O
of O
chest B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
trouble B-ADR
breathing I-ADR
, O
and O
feeling O
really O
tired B-ADR
. O

My O
doctor O
said O
those O
are O
n't O
side O
effects O
of O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
. O

After O
I O
got O
off O
the O
phone O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
looked O
up O
the O
side O
effects O
, O
and O
yes O
those O
side O
effects O
are O
listed O
. O

The O
ER O
prescribed O
me O
anxiety B-ADR
medicine O
if O
I O
start O
having O
chest B-ADR
pain I-ADR
again O
and O
trouble B-ADR
breathing I-ADR
. O


From O
what O
I O
read O
, O
Metformin B-DRUG
is O
not O
only O
cheap O
but O
it O
is O
a O
good O
drug O
. O

  O
Some O
of O
the O
other O
diabetic O
medications O
work O
in O
ways O
that O
, O
imho O
, O
can O
cause O
longer O
term O
problems O
. O



 O
While O
not O
everyone O
can O
tolerate O
it O
, O
it O
's O
well O
worth O
an O
attempt O
to O
ramp O
up O
on O
it O
slowly O
. O

   O
Many O
doctors O
start O
with O
a O
smaller O
dosage O
and O
ramp O
you O
up O
. O

  O
Always O
take O
it O
with O
a O
meal O
. O



 O
I O
take O
750 O
twice O
per O
day O
. O

  O
Every O
now O
and O
again O
, O
if O
I O
have O
too O
much O
fat O
or O
a O
significant O
enough O
" O
carb O
cheat O
" O
, O
I O
will O
have O
some O
" O
fallout O
" O
but O
it O
's O
the O
exception O
rather O
than O
the O
rule O
. O


I O
agree O
here O
BUT O
with O
the O
caveat O
that O
there O
are O
systemic O
problems O
as O
well O
. O



 O
In O
my O
hospital O
I O
worry O
about O
: O


 O
1 O
. O

Midazolam B-DRUG
and O
Furosemide B-DRUG
are O
both O
in O
identical O
size O
and O
shape O
brown O
single O
dose O
vials O
with O
orange O
caps O


 O
2 O
. O

When O
looking O
for O
a O
medication O
in O
the O
pyxis O
, O
you O
need O
the O
right O
name O
. O

If O
you O
hit O
' O
V O
' O
looking O
for O
Versed B-DRUG
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
find O
it O
, O
you O
would O
find O
Vecuronium B-DRUG
though O
. O

You O
need O
to O
search O
for O
' O
M O
' O
for O
midaz O


 O
This O
case O
will O
absolutely O
have O
a O
chilling O
effect O
. O

Fewer O
people O
reporting O
errors O
means O
more O
mistakes O
since O
systemic O
problems O
do O
n't O
get O
fixed O
, O
like O
the O
above O
. O


Anecdotally O
I O
did O
notice O
more O
hair O
on O
my O
pillow O
earlier O
on O
my O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
treatment O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
gotten O
better O
. O

Although O
I O
have O
n‚Äôt O
been O
paying O
much O
attention O
- O
male B-ADR
pattern I-ADR
baldness I-ADR
runs O
high O
in O
the O
family O
so O
I O
‚Äôm O
a O
lost O
cause O
anyway O
:) O

I O
started O
with O
enbrel B-DRUG
, O
then O
humira B-DRUG
, O
then O
stellara O
, O
now O
on O
taltz B-DRUG
. O

They O
were O
all O
effective O
for O
me O
, O
but O
taltz B-DRUG
by O
far O
worked O
the O
most O
quickly O
. O

I O
went O
from O
about O
50 O
% O
of O
my O
body O
covered O
and O
7/10 O
daily O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
to O
completely O
clear O
skin O
and O
almost O
no O
pain B-ADR
after O
the O
initial O
starter O
dose O
. O

It O
was O
mind O
- O
boggling O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
worked O
well O
also O
. O

If O
you O
had O
initial O
, O
long O
- O
term O
success O
with O
enbrel B-DRUG
, O
humira B-DRUG
should O
work O
just O
fine O
. O

Good O
luck O
. O


I O
‚Äôm O
getting O
hot B-ADR
/ I-ADR
burning I-ADR
feeling I-ADR
in O
my O
feet O
I O
think O
it O
started O
after O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
did O
u O
find O
the O
root O
cause O
? O


I O
've O
tried O
a O
couple O
of O
different O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
methods O
. O

I O
took O
Gianvi O
at O
one O
point O
and O
then O
switched O
to O
the O
generic O
form O
of O
Seasonique B-DRUG
. O

I O
think O
they O
both O
worked O
fine O
but O
I O
had O
trouble O
remembering O
to O
take O
them O
regularly O
. O

I O
also O
took O
them O
continuously O
  O
and O
skipped O
the O
sugar O
pills O
week O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
have O
any O
sort O
of O
bleeding B-ADR
ever O
and O
so O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
period O
flare B-ADR
ups I-ADR
. O



 O
Currently O
I O
'm O
on O
the O
Xulane B-DRUG
patch O
and O
that O
's O
great O
for O
not O
having O
to O
remember O
as O
often O
to O
take O
a O
pill O
. O

I O
also O
do O
continuous O
coverage O
with O
the O
patch O
and O
skip O
the O
week O
off O
. O

Before O
all O
of O
this O
I O
was O
on O
Nexplanon B-DRUG
. O

Have O
n't O
had O
any O
bleeding B-ADR
in O
about O
4 O
years O
and O
it O
's O
done O
wonders O
. O



 O
I O
will O
add O
that O
I O
was O
put O
on O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
because O
spironolactone B-DRUG
causes O
birth B-ADR
defects I-ADR
and O
we O
did O
n't O
want O
that O
happening O
, O
so O
controlling O
the O
hormonal O
flare O
ups O
was O
a O
happy O
accident O
. O



 O
Edit O
to O
say O
that O
I O
only O
take O
metformin B-DRUG
and O
my O
birth B-ADR
control I-ADR
patch O
and O
my O
HS O
has O
not O
progressed O
any O
further O
. O

I O
tried O
rifampin B-DRUG
/ O
Clindamycin B-DRUG
in O
all O
their O
forms O
but O
they O
did O
n't O
help O
. O

I O
did O
do O
a O
round O
of O
azithromycin B-DRUG
for O
an O
unrelated O
reason O
and O
that O
healed O
my O
one O
spot O
that O
's O
been O
open O
for O
years O
. O


I O
started O
Zoloft B-DRUG
this O
year O
but O
that O
has O
n't O
gone O
away O
for O
me O
. O

I O
'm O
on O
a O
low O
dose O
though O
. O


I O
do O
suffer O
of O
social B-ADR
anxiety I-ADR
so O
I O
take O
propanolol B-DRUG
which O
lower B-ADR
my I-ADR
heart I-ADR
rate I-ADR
, O
so O
did O
n‚Äôt O
have O
that O
symptoms O

I O
was O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
for O
3 O
weeks O
and O
just O
started O
tapering O
. O

It O
helped O
temporarily O
, O
but O
the O
flare B-ADR
would O
just O
come O
back O
the O
next O
morning O
. O

Prednisone B-DRUG
itself O
has O
dampened O
my O
mood O
a O
bit O
. O

Usually O
pretty O
optimistic O
, O
active O
guy O
, O
but O
my O
mood O
has O
definitely O
taken O
a O
hit O
. O

Although O
, O
just O
being O
bed O
- O
ridden O
as O
a O
result O
of O

at O

his O

My O

on O
Metformin B-DRUG

I O
was O
sick O
of O
going O
to O
the O
chemist O
every O
3 O
weeks O
for O
more O
so O
got O
the O
dr O
to O
prescribe O
two O
boxes O
at O
a O
time O
instead O
of O
one O
and O
the O
price O
was O
the O
same O
. O


Yep O
we O
talked O
about O
it O
at O
our O
annual O
feedback O
meeting O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
on O
a O
string O
of O
PTO O
inelligible O
months O
so O
it O
's O
moot O
anyway O
. O



 O
I O
admit O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
best O
self O
care O
. O

I O
work O
. O

I O
prioritize O
work O
. O

I O
like O
to O
learn O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
because O
I O
like O
many O
things O
. O

As O
my O
faculty O
put O
it O
- O
I O
like O
too O
many O
things O
. O

And O
maybe O
that O
's O
true O
. O

I O
like O
my O
trans O
patients O
. O

I O
like O
my O
teen O
patients O

I O
like O
my O

I O

my O
OMT O

 O
Does O
prescribing O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
give O
me O
excitement O
? O

No O
. O

But O
really O
getting O
into O
the O
nitty O
gritties O
of O
why O
they O
eat O
poorly O
and O
what O
can O
do O
practically O
and O
tangibly O
to O
adjust O
that O
beyond O
" O
eat O
better O
" O
does O
. O



 O
And O
maybe O
that O
's O
why O
I O
'm O
frustrated O
. O

Because O
the O
powers O
at O
be O
make O
it O
hard O
to O
have O
multiple O
interests O
out O
in O

when O

reigns O
supreme O

Cheers O

though O
I O
took O
yaz B-DRUG
in O
the O
past O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
feel O
like O
this O

it O
is O
having O
some O
type O
of O
combination O
with O
the O
metformin B-DRUG
at O
a O
higher O
dose O
? O



 O
what O
you O
said O
about O

interesting O
. O

I O
have O
a O
documented O
medical O
history O
of O
depression B-ADR
but O
was O
n't O
told O
this O
and O
was O
given O
provera B-DRUG
. O

it O
made O
me O
super O
depressed B-ADR
and O
borderline O
suicidal B-ADR
. O

scary O
stuff O

Honestly O
I O
‚Äôve O

taking O
Metformin B-DRUG

put O
it O
back O

Absolutely O
give O
it O
a O
go O
because O
it O
works O
for O
most O
people O
but O
really O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
‚Äôve O
seen O
work O
for O
me O
is O
drastically O
reducing O
my O

shy O
of O

If O
chemo O

getting O
hit O
by O
a O

Generally O
they O
will O
have O
you O
do O
the O
first O

as O
well O

sounds O

there O
are O
some O

I O
think O
it O
's O
more O
important O
that O
we O
look O
at O
how O
we O
can O
prevent O

'd O
occasionally O

would O

If O
you O
need O
to O
draw O
up O
meds O
in O
advance O
, O
label O
the O
syringe O
in O
some O
way O
. O

I O
usually O
just O
tape O
the O
vial O
right O
to O
the O
syringe O
so O
I O
can O
double O

check O
drug O

concentration O

or O
keep O
the O
needle O
attached O

physically O
inside O
the O

something O

you O
can O
ID O
what O
is O

 O
Fortunately O
, O
this O
was O
a O
small O
error O
, O
but O
easy O
to O
happen O
to O
any O
of O
us O
. O

I O
've O
made O
med O
errors O
in O
the O
past O
too O

which O
is O
why O
I O

My O
family O
has O
HBP O
history O
and O
I O
ended O
up O
on O
a O
small O
dose O
of O

because O
I O
was O
edging O

The O
cellcept B-DRUG
keeps O
my O

from O
making O

cells O
which O
is O
what O
is O
attacking O
my O
eyes O
. O

Birdshot O
is O
an O
inflammatory O
disease O
of O
the O
retina O
and O
back O
of O
the O
eye O
. O


The O
goal O
is O
to O
suppress O
my O
immune O
system O
enough O
to O
stop O
the O
chronic O
inflammation B-ADR
and O
resulting O
damage O

cellcept B-DRUG
puts O
me O

I O

no O

Our O

can O
compensate O
in O
extraordinary O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O

my O

told O

like O

I O
felt O

was O
n‚Äôt O

wo O
n‚Äôt O
knock O

off O

have O
literally O
made O
me O
more O
motivated O
than O
I O
was O
before O

Only O
downside O
is O
it O
makes O

nauseous B-ADR

I O
hate O

The O
gastroenterologist O
who O
did O
the O

I O

the O
one O

what O
I O
have O
in O

exactly O

I O

now O
I O
take O
a O

Yes O

I O

this O

originally O
wrote O
that O
he O
had O
Type O

, O
lost O

, O
went O
off O

Any O
experiences O
with O
Lithium B-DRUG
? O

? O

Doctor O
prescribed O
me O
that O
today O
but O
my O
entire O
understanding O
of O
the O
drug O
is O
an O
Evanescence O

was O
addicted B-ADR

any O

I O

think O
the O

out O
worked O
well O
enough O
for O
me O
. O

that O

would O

: O
devote O
hours O
to O

of O

they O
LOVE O
asking O
about O
those O
, O
memorize O
a O
chart O
or O
at O
least O
be O
able O
to O
get O
most O
of O
those O
questions O

watch O

focus O
on O
the O
most O
common O
ones O

if O
you O
do O
any O
review O
of O
your O
UW O
incorrects O

NBMEs O
or O
Free O

this O
week O

ask O
yourself O
if O
you O
know O
the O
mechanism O
for O
most O
drugs O
mentioned O
on O
there O
. O

sounds O
like O
a O
lot O
but O
it O
is O
n't O
because O
the O
same O
guys O
will O
come O
up O
constantly O
: O
ACEs O
and O
ARBs O
, O
metformin B-DRUG
and O
all O
other O
diabetes O
drugs O
( O
breaks O
my O
brain O
that O
they O
all O
have O
" O

somewhere O

, O
common O
psych O

bonus O

be O
hormonal O

chemotherapies O
and O
anything O
to O
do O
with O

. O

I O
took O
this O
exam O
after O
my O
clinical O
rotations O
so O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
felt O
pretty O
familiar O
anyway O
. O

totally O
do O
- O
able O
and O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
to O
have O
confidence O
in O
how O
you O
've O
more O
or O
less O
muddled O
through O
up O
till O
now O

Honestly O
, O
the O
problem O
with O
any O
podcast O
which O
attempts O
to O
deliver O
core O
content O
is O
that O
, O
eventually O
, O
you O
've O
covered O
all O
the O
core O
content O
and O
your O
options O
are O
either O
to O
cover O
it O
again O
( O
and O
then O
people O
yell O
about O
repetition O
) O
or O
move O
into O
new O
takes O
. O

You O
could O
switch O
to O
a O
case O
- O
based O
platform O
if O
that O
's O
what O
you O
're O
looking O
for O
as O
suggested O
by O
a O
few O
others O
, O
but O
what O
I O
'd O
really O
recommend O
is O
going O
back O
a O
few O
years O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
original O
stuff O
if O
you O
have O
n't O
already O
before O
abandoning O
it O
altogether O
. O



 O
I O
agree O
I O
tend O
to O
skip O
their O
rural O
medicine O
talks O
unless O
I O
'm O
just O
feeling O
like O

I O
frankly O
do O
n't O
get O
much O
out O
of O
primary O
care O
approaches O
) O
but O
still O
find O
their O
critical O
care O
reviews O
and O
EMA O
to O
be O
very O
helpful O
. O

I O
also O
tend O
to O
get O
a O
nice O
refresher O
on O
the O
basics O
when O
listening O
to O
their O
other O
pieces O
( O
like O
what O
's O

up O

this O

I O

phase O
where O
I O
was O
drinking O

all O

every O

it O
gave O
me O
rly O

even O
though O
I O
‚Äôve O
stopped O
that O
for O

I O
‚Äôm O
still O

you O
get O
used O

it O

Truly O
. O

Yet O
it O
still O
does O
n't O
dismiss O
the O
feelings O
you O
will O
still O
get O
regardless O

know O
that O
it O
is O
normal O

31 O

3 O

I O
will O
be O

I O
remember O
when O
I O
first O
felt O
my O
son O
move O

I O
was O
not O
for O
it O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
feeling O
. O

Also O
hated O
how O
I O
had O
to O
give O
up O
so O
much O
for O
so O
long O
. O

After O
a O
while O
though O
, O
I O
got O
used O
to O
it O
and O
realized O
that O
it O
was O
all O
worth O
it O
no O
matter O
how O
badly O
I O
wanted O
it O
to O
be O
over O

be O

‚Äôve O
read O
that O
in O

usually O
the O
Plaquenil B-DRUG

 O
Treatment O
should O

what O

Treatment O
choice O

what O
you O

Hello O
there O
! O

As O
a O
five O
year O
veteran O
of O

psychic O
wars O
, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
from O
first O
- O
hand O
experience O
that O
Sertraline B-DRUG
might O
well O
have O
saved O
my O
life O
. O

Early O
on O
in O
my O
college O
years O
, O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
OCD B-ADR
following O
a O
general O
collapse O
of O
my O
mental O
well O
- O
being O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
my O
Undergraduate O
years O
of O
College O
, O
I O
suffered B-ADR
what O
is O
often O
called O
a O
' O
mental O
breakdown O
' O
, O
though O
this O
is O
a O
term O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
taken O
with O
more O
than O
a O
pinch O
. O



 O
While O
I O
had O
been O
resistant O
to O
taking O
drugs O
to O
help O
my O
condition O
( O
I O
have O
both O
OCD B-ADR
and O
ASD B-ADR
) O
, O
I O
eventually O
realised O
, O
that O
the O
waves O
of O
intrusive O
thoughts O
were O
breaking O
me O
down O
and O
making O
a O
' O
normal O
and O
productive O
' O
life O
impossible O
. O

  O
I O
was O
first O
put O
on O
Fluoxetine B-DRUG
( O
50 O
mg O
) O
, O
but O
this O
did O
very O
little O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
arguably O
made O
my O
condition O
worse O
and O
led O
to O
what O
felt O
like O
full O
- O
blown O
depression B-ADR
( O

do O
n't O
want O
to O
overhype O
my O
experience O

. O



 O
Sertraline B-DRUG
has O
helped O
clear O
my O
mind O
and O
lower O
my O
general O
skittishness O
. O

Though O
I O
'm O
on O
a O
relatively O
low O
dosage O
( O
50 O
mg O
) O
, O
it O
has O
been O
enough O
to O
empower O
me O
to O
combat O
anxieties B-ADR
and O
intrusive O
thoughts O
with O
relative O
ease O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
cure O
- O
all O
, O
but O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
that O
help O
me O
live O
a O
productive O
life O
( O
even O
through O
and O
after O
lockdown O
) O
. O


Metformin B-DRUG
helps O
. O


My O
dude O
have O
you O
tried O
metformin B-DRUG
bc O
I O
can O
guarantee O
it O
will O
turn O
you O
into O
a O
shitting O
machine O
. O

Is O
it O
pleasant O
? O

Nah O
. O

But O
do O
I O
evacuate O
my O
bowels O
quickly O
and O
in O
a O
timely O
fashion O
every O
morning O
. O

Yes O
. O


I O
have O
cycled O
on O
and O
off O
prozac B-DRUG
probably O
about O
2 O
- O
3 O
times O
now O
. O

Prozac B-DRUG
helped O
me O
get O
past O
some O
pretty O
bad O
flare B-ADR
ups I-ADR
and O
internalize O
some O
OCD B-ADR
coping O
strategies O
. O

I O
had O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
reading O
and O
knew O
the O
right O
way O
to O
treat O
OCD B-ADR
but O
never O
felt O
like O
it O
" O
stuck O
" O
. O



 O
Well O
after O
this O
latest O
cycle O
( O
3 O
months O
on O
40 O
mg O
of O
prozac B-DRUG
) O
I O
honestly O
feel O
like O
my O
OCD B-ADR
is O
completely O
managed O
now O
. O

I O
am O
not O
on O
it O
anymore O
but O
highly O
recommend O
giving O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

Prozac B-DRUG
also O
has O
a O
long O
half O
life O
so O
coming O
off O
it O
typically O
is O
n't O
as O
" O
hellish O
" O
. O



 O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
would O
have O
gotten O
to O
where O
I O
was O
without O
a O
leg O
up O
from O
Prozac B-DRUG
. O


I O
'm O
really O
sorry O
that O
you O
are O
feeling O
this O
way O
. O

You O
may O
likely O
just O
need O
to O
give O
the O
medication O
some O
more O
time O
as O
it O
can O
take O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
time O
to O
help O
, O
so O
hang O
in O
there O
. O

As O
I O
'm O
sure O
you O
have O
seen O
across O
this O
thread O
you O
should O
really O
try O
to O
exercise O
, O
get O
therapy O
and O
meditate O
as O
these O
all O
really O
really O
help O
, O
just O
as O
good O
or O
better O
than O
medication O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Try O
a O
book O
called O
Feeling O
Good O
by O
David O
Burns O
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
book O
and O
really O
really O
helpful O
. O

In O
addition O
it O
also O
has O
a O
full O
analysis O
of O
all O
of O
the O
available O
medication O
so O
you O
can O
read O
further O
into O
how O
Zoloft B-DRUG
works O
and O
it O
's O
side O
effects O
etc O
. O



 O
Hope O
that O
helps O
you O
. O


I O
've O
been O
on O
crestor B-DRUG
about O
5 O
years O
with O
no O
issues O
. O



 O
about O
15 O
years O
ago O
in O
my O
early O
20s O
I O
was O
put O
on O
lipitor B-DRUG
and O
had O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in O
my O
legs O
/ O
butt O
so O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
and O
was O
afraid O
to O
try O
again O
so O
waited O
almost O
10 O
years O
before O
trying O
again O
. O

Wish O
I O
started O
with O
crestor B-DRUG
instead O
of O
lipitor B-DRUG
. O

sometimes O
wonder O
if O
not O
taking O
it O
for O
those O
10 O
years O
will O
hurt O
my O
long O
term O
prospects O
. O



 O
The O
muscle B-ADR
pain I-ADR
came O
on O
gradually O
over O
about O
two O
months O
and O
went O
away O
slowly O
over O
about O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
time O
. O


I O
work O
nights O
, O
i O
had O
a O
dayshift O
nurse O
ask O
me O
whether O
the O
lasix B-DRUG
that O
was O
given O
yesterday O
during O
the O
day O
was O
iv O
or O
po O
‚Ä¶ O
. O


58F O
, O
MS O
36 O
years O
. O



 O
I O
know O
you O
ca O
n't O
at O
this O
late O
hour O
, O
but O
on O
Monday O
, O
call O
the O
AlongSide O
coordinator O
; O
they O
should O
have O
someone O
who O
would O
know O
. O



 O
In O
the O
meantime O
, O
if O
you O
have O
not O
taken O
the O
Kesimpta B-DRUG
, O
you O
're O
okay O
to O
be O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
late O
with O
it O
. O

I O
had O
to O
hold O
off O
on O
my O
dosing O
schedule O
one O
time O
due O
to O
a O
bad O
sinus B-ADR
infection I-ADR
( O
I O
was O
Covid O
negative O
) O
and O
nothing O
untoward O
happened O
. O



 O
FWIW O
, O
my O
personal O
opinion O
is O
, O
go O
ahead O
and O
take O
the O
Kesimpta B-DRUG
. O

Those O
who O
are O
on O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
get O
IV O
steroids O
with O
each O
dose O
of O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
and O
that O
always O
goes O
well O
, O
and O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
is O
at O
a O
much O
higher O
dose O
than O
just O
one O
Kesimpta B-DRUG
shot O
. O


Finally O
one O
I O
can O
help O
with O
lol O
. O

I O
tried O
Aimovig B-DRUG
and O
initially O
it O
was O
amazing O
, O
essentially O
migraine O
free O
for O
about O
6 O
- O
7 O
months O
. O

However O
at O
about O
the O
7 O
month O
mark O
it O
just O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
for O
me O
. O

After O
a O
couple O
more O
months O
of O
it O
not O
helping O
, O
my O
neuro O
switched O
me O
to O
Emgality B-DRUG
. O

Emgality B-DRUG
was O
n‚Äôt O
quite O
as O
effected O
but O
definitely O
made O
a O
difference O
for O
about O
10 O
months O
, O
then O
it O
also O
just O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
for O
me O
. O

My O
insurance O
ended O
up O
pulling O
coverage O
because O
it O
was O
n‚Äôt O
all O
that O
effective O
and O
not O
worth O
the O
cost O
. O

At O
that O
point O
, O
having O
tried O
a O
bilateral O
occipital O
nerve O
block O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
switch O
over O
to O
Botox B-DRUG
injections O
and O
propanolol B-DRUG
. O

While O
taking O
Aimovig B-DRUG
, O
I O
experienced O
some O
constipation B-ADR
( O
significantly O
less O
than O
on O
verapamil B-DRUG
and O
opiates O
) O
. O

On O
Emgality B-DRUG
I O
experienced O
constipation B-ADR
and O
hair B-ADR
loss I-ADR
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
had O
no O
negative O
side O
effects O
with O
Botox B-DRUG
and O
propanolol B-DRUG
. O

We O
also O
decided O
to O
do O
a O
hormonal O
IUD O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
so O
that O
trio O
, O
Botox B-DRUG
+ O
propanolol B-DRUG
+ O
Mirena B-DRUG
IUD O
, O
has O
been O
my O
magic O
bullet O
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
had O
five O
or O
six O
migraines B-ADR
in O
the O
last O
15 O
months O
, O
which O
is O
a O
personal O
best O
since O
I O
started O
getting O
them O
when O
I O
was O
15 O
. O

Absolutely O
would O
recommend O
trying O
Botox B-DRUG
. O

Very O
low O
risk O
, O
but O
with O
huge O
reward O
. O


Meds O
they O
use O
can O
damage B-ADR
dental I-ADR
health I-ADR
. O

Prednisone B-DRUG
is O
one O
of O
many O
that O
can O
weaken B-ADR
teeth I-ADR
and I-ADR
bones I-ADR
. O


Tecfidera B-DRUG
gave O
me O
bad O
heartburn B-ADR
and O
I O
ended O
up O
having O
a O
relapse B-ADR
. O

I O
switched O
to O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
in O
January O
2021 O
and O
I O
really O
like O
it O
. O

No O
relapses O
or O
side O
effects O
and O
I O
only O
have O
to O
think O
about O
medication O
twice O
a O
year O
. O


Gon O
na O
Need O
lipitor B-DRUG
or O
ER O
after O
that O

No O
, O
they O
did O
compare O
to O
diabetics O
using O
metformin B-DRUG
, O
but O
not O
within O
a O
90 O
day O
window O
of O
inception O
. O

And O
that O
eliminated O
the O
variance O
. O

I O
think O
you O
're O
underestimating O
the O
significance O
here O
. O


I O
felt O
I O
was O
losing B-ADR
hair I-ADR
immediately O
after O
starting O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
, O
but O
it O
seemed O
to O
stop O
before O
the O
next O
dose O
( O
six O
months O
later O
) O
, O
and O
I O
have O
not O
noticed O
it O
since O
. O

I O
wonder O
now O
if O
it O
was O
n‚Äôt O
just O
related O
to O
the O
stress O
of O
diagnosis O
. O


So O
sorry O
I O
have O
n't O
checked O
into O
reddit O
so O
i O
did O
n't O
see O
what O
you O
wrote O
until O
today O
. O



 O
Susan O
polizzi O
was O
great O
, O
i O
recommend O
her O
and O
learned O
about O
her O
from O
this O
post O
. O

  O
She O
also O
does O
video O
visits O
! O

! O



 O
I O
got O
diagnosed O
with O
either O
pots B-ADR
or O
just O
dysautomia B-ADR
and O
got O
propanolol B-DRUG
, O
a O
beta O
blocker O
, O
but O
I O
have O
n't O
taken O
it O
yet O
- O
my O
blood O
pressure O
gets O
very O
low O
sometimes O
and O
propanolol B-DRUG
would O
make O
it O
dangerously O
low O
. O

So O
I O
was O
told O
to O
buy O
a O
blood O
pressure B-ADR
monitor O
and O
if O
is O
above O
a O
certain O
# O
, O
  O
i O
can O
try O
propanolol B-DRUG
. O

I O
ve O
been O
bad O
about O
keeping O

It O

get O

it O

just O
fine O

My O
friend O
was O
on O
150 O
mg O
for O
2 O
years O
and O
tapered O
off O
successfully O
. O



 O
Look O
into O
Propanolol B-DRUG
to O
ease O
your O
physical O
symptoms O
! O


My O
immune O
tests O
came O
back O
. O

I O
have O
‚Äú O
pretty O
elevated O
‚Äù O
cytokines O
that O
will O
make O
it O
unlikely O
to O
get O
pregnant O
if O
they O
do O
n‚Äôt O
decrease O
. O

Slightly O
elevated O
NK O
cells O
also O
. O

The O
cytokines O
are O
likely O
compromising O
egg O
quality O
as O
well O
as O
making O
implantation O
impossible O
. O

The O
RE O
is O
going O
to O
defer O
to O
my O
regular O
immunologist O
on O
treatment O
since O
she O
thinks O
this O
is O
due O
to O
MCAS O
. O



 O
Separately O
, O
I O
have O
significant O
HLA O
matching O
with O
my O
male O
partner O
. O

Assuming O
my O
cytokines O
are O
lowered O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
pregnant O
, O
there O
is O
only O
a O
50 O
% O
chance O
that O
any O
given O
embryo O
would O
be O
HLA O
- O
compatible O
. O

IVF O
would O
involve O
IVIG O
, O
Neupogen B-DRUG
, O
and O
prednisone B-DRUG
. O

She O
‚Äôs O
not O
an O
RI O
, O
so O
I O
‚Äôm O
not O
sure O
whether O
to O
get O
a O
second O
opinion O
. O

The O
internet O
seems O
to O
offer O
conflicting O
stories O
about O
HLA O
matching O
. O



 O
Not O
sure O
how O
I O
feel O
about O
it O
all O
. O

Depressed B-ADR
, O
I O
guess O
, O
but O
less O
anxious O
, O
since O
we O
finally O
have O
some O
answers O
. O


Lamictal B-DRUG
, O
150 O
mg O
, O
Lipitor B-DRUG
, O
50 O
mg O
, O
and O
for O
my O
problems O
, O
Sertralin B-DRUG
Hexal O
, O
50 O
mg O
or O
something O
‚Ä¶ O
it O
does O
n‚Äôt O
work O

... O

I O
work O
with O
ceramics O

stained O

for O
a O

I O
am O
on O
Seroquel B-DRUG

propanolol B-DRUG
( O
beta O

) O
for O
anxiety B-ADR

So O
far O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
creativity O
, O
but O
it O
has O
only O
been O
4 O
months O
. O

I O
hate O
that O
you O
are O
experiencing O
this O
. O


Thanks O
. O

Wow O
- O
you‚Äôre O
the O
first O
person O
I O
have O
heard O
say O
that O
5htp O
worked O
better O
for O
you O
then O
Zoloft B-DRUG
, O
or O
another O
SSRI O
. O

Also O
, O
why O
is O
n‚Äôt O
5htp O
healthy O
to O
take O
long O
term O
? O

I O
always O
thought O
it O
‚Äôs O
better O
than O
an O
artificial O
drug O
like O
Zoloft B-DRUG
‚Ä¶ O
curious O
to O
hear O
your O
take O
on O
this O
. O


Well O
she O
says O
since O
it O
‚Äôs O
familial O
( O
my O
aunt O
, O
mom O
, O
grandma O
all O
have O
it O
too O
) O
diet O
is O
not O
going O
to O
change O
it O
much O
, O
she O
gave O
me O
Atorvastatin B-DRUG
20 O
mg O
but O
said O
to O
not O
take O
it O
everyday O
because O
she O
wants O
my O
cholesterol O
levels O
to O
not O
go O
down O
that O
much O
so O
she O
can O
get O
my O
insurance O
to O
cover O
for O
my O
injections O
, O
she O
wants O
to O
start O
me O
next O
month O
. O


Also O
I O
‚Äôm O
30(F O
) O
and O
have O
had O
high O
cholesterol O
since O
I O
was O
a O
teen O
weighting O
100 O
lb O
, O
I O
ca O
n‚Äôt O
even O
remember O
a O
time O
when O
my O
cholesterol O
was O
within O
normal O
ranges O
üòû O

I O
was O
put O
on O
propanolol B-DRUG
for O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
( O
it O
helps O
with O
the O
sympathetic O
nervous O
system O
symptoms O
e.g. O
heart O
palpitations B-ADR
etc O
) O
, O
and O
a O
new O
drug O
called O
viibryd B-DRUG
. O

  O
Game O
changers O
I O
now O
feel O
normal O
and O
am O
able O
to O
function O
and O
enjoy O
life O
. O


No O
problem O
, O
ocd B-ADR
makes O
me O
feel O
pretty O
lonely O
as O
well O
. O

Instead O
of O
Zoloft B-DRUG
you O
could O
try O
Prozac B-DRUG
if O
a O
psychiatrist O
prescribes O
it O
. O

I O
have O
n‚Äôt O
had O
an O
experience O
with O
Prozac B-DRUG
but O
I O
‚Äôve O
heard O
it O
‚Äôs O
another O
medicine O
used O
for O
treating O
ocd B-ADR

I O
was O
on O
Lexapro B-DRUG
before O
diagnosis O
. O

Switched O
to O
Prozac B-DRUG
after O
my O
second O
craniotomy O
last O
year O
. O

Also O
take O
20 O
mg O
adderall B-DRUG
XR O

I O
‚Äôm O
on O
50 O
mg O
Vyvanse B-DRUG
as O
well O
as O
fluoxetine B-DRUG
and O
propranolol B-DRUG
for O
anxiety B-ADR
and O
depression B-ADR
. O

The O
propanolol B-DRUG
works O
really O
well O
for O
the O
physical O
effects O
of O
anxiety B-ADR
, O
and O
the O
fluoxetine B-DRUG
helps O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
but O
it O
mostly O
helps O
the O
depression B-ADR
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
actually O
thinking O
about O
reducing O
my O
Vyvanse B-DRUG
dose O
or O
going O
off O
completely O
because O
I O
‚Äôm O
not O
sure O
its O
even O
working O
for O
me O
. O

But O
so O
far O
my O
current O
combo O
of O
meds O
has O
been O
fine O
and O
has O
nt O
caused O
any O
issues O
. O


Hopefully O
the O
Lasix B-DRUG
& O
drains O
should O
help O
with O
the O
edema B-ADR
/ O
congestion B-ADR
. O

How O
are O
* O
you O

how O

you O

start O
taking O
your O
SSRI O

again O
? O

i O
am O
also O
on O
10 O
mg O
of O
Fluoxetine B-DRUG

trying O

figure O
out O

stopping O

over O

at O
EDC O

Very O
amused O
American O
pharmacist O
here O

 O
So O
let O
's O
say O
the O
doctor O
writes O
prescription O
for O
30 O
opioid O
tablets O
and O
you O
only O
have O
a O
bottle O
of O
100 O

You O
dispense O
the O
100 O
and O
expect O
the O
person O
to O
bring O
it O
back O
the O
other O
70 O
? O

? O

üòÇ O


 O
But O
for O
real O
this O
would O
make O
my O
job O
so O
much O
easier O
than O
to O
count O
out O
180 O
metformin B-DRUG

gabapentin B-DRUG
all O
the O
time O

Here O

Come O

an O
even O

losing O

keep O
it O

rarely O

at O

 O
You O
deserve O
ACTUAL O
medical O
care O
. O

For O
me O
, O
letrozole B-DRUG
was O
very O
effective O
. O

It O
took O
about O
4 O
- O
5 O
months O
to O
get O
up O
to O
the O
correct O
dose O
to O
make O
me O
ovulate O
. O

Then O
once O
we O
got O
to O
the O
right O
dose O
, O
I O
got O
pregnant O
twice O
, O
two O
cycles O
in O
a O
row O
. O

( O
The O
first O
was O
a O
miscarriage B-ADR
, O
the O
second O
is O
my O
2 O
year O
old O
) O
. O

It O
was O
also O
reasonably O
cheap O
. O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
recall O
how O
much O
we O
paid O
, O
but O
I O
think O
insurance O
covered O
part O
of O
it O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
was O
like O
‚Ä¶ O
less O
than O
$ O
100 O
a O
month O
for O
generic O
. O

And O
, O
fyi O
, O
I O
recently O
learned O
that O
my O
regular O
obgyn O
can O
prescribe O
letrozole B-DRUG
, O
I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
actually O
need O
the O
expensive O
reproductive O
endocrinologist O
to O
prescribe O
it O
, O
though O
after O
3 O
- O
4 O
years O
, O
you O
probably O
want O
to O
do O
diagnostic O
testing O
to O
confirm O
if O
there O
is O
an O
issue O
besides O
ovulation O
. O



 O
This O
time O
( O
trying O
to O
get O
pregnant O
) O
, O
I O
have O
diabetes O
, O
and O
was O
put O
on O
metformin B-DRUG
. O

That O
is O
making O
my O
PCOS O
better O
enough O
that O
I O
ovulate O
by O
myself O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
also O
super O
cheap O
. O

With O
insurance O
, O
like O
‚Ä¶ O
under O
$ O
10 O
for O
generic O
for O
a O
3 O
month O
supply O
. O



 O
Clomid B-DRUG
and O
letrozole B-DRUG
( O
and O
sometimes O
metformin B-DRUG
) O
often O
work O
really O
  O
well O
for O
people O
with O
pcos O
. O

So O
if O
you O
have O
n‚Äôt O
tried O
them O
, O
and O
your O
doctors O
just O
say O
‚Äú O
lose B-ADR
weight I-ADR
‚Äù O
, O
push O
back O
or O
find O
new O
doctors O
. O


See O
I O
have O
script O
for O
Prozac B-DRUG
but O
I O
read O
into O
that O
and O
I O
like O
the O
idea O
that O
it O
helps O
with O
GBM O
but O
it O
can O
negatively O
interact O
with O
the O
keppra B-DRUG
I O
take O
and O
I O
‚Äôm O
terrified O
of O
having O
a O
seizure B-ADR
again O

Prednisone B-DRUG
is O
the O
bees O
knees O
other O
than O
making O
my O
hunger B-ADR
insatiable I-ADR
. O

fastest O
way O
to O
stop O
the O
pain B-ADR
from O
a O
gout B-ADR
flare B-ADR
for O
sure O
though O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
not O
doing O
intense O
20k O
step O
workouts O
when O
you O
feel O
any O
sort O
of O
discomfort B-ADR
in O
your O

. O

maybe O
ride O
a O

when O
you O
feel O
the O
twinge O

hit O
or O
something O
else O
low O

Atorvastatin B-DRUG

literally O
free O

at O
most O

our O
local O

for O
most O

That O

why O

So O
much O

Better O

my O
Zoloft B-DRUG
lol O

would O
n‚Äôt O

tomorrow O
. O

And O
if O
I O
do O
X O
, O
then O
my O
afternoon O
has O
a O
50/50 O
chance O
of O
being O
totally O
shot O
. O

‚Äù O


 O
So O
I O
‚Äôm O
not O
very O
good O
with O
spontaneity O
. O

I O
still O
can O
be O
social O
or O
active O
, O
but O
I O
need O
time O
before O
to O
plan O
my O
body O
properly O
, O
and O
I O
may O
need O
time O
after O
to O
recover O
. O

And O
of O
course O
there O
‚Äôs O
always O
a O
chance O
it O
‚Äôll O
be O
a O
shit O
pain B-ADR
day O
anyway O
. O



 O
Heck O
I O
knew O
I O
‚Äôd O
be O
able O
to O
get O
another O
short O
course O
of O
prednisone B-DRUG
from O
my O
doctor O
so O
I O
intentionally O
made O
big O
cleaning O
and O
organizing O
plans O
with O
myself O
because O
I O
knew O
I O
could O
get O
it O
done O
. O



 O
People O
just O
do O
n‚Äôt O
get O
it O
. O

Unexpected O
plans O
( O
< O
48 O
hours O
) O
that O
involve O
me O
to O
leave O
the O
house O
or O
* O
do O
* O
something O
breaks O
my O
brain O
a O
bit O
because O
then O
I O
need O
to O
negotiate O
with O
myself O
to O
cut O
other O
things O
or O
add O
rest O
time O
to O
ensure O
I O
‚Äôm O
the O
least O
broken O
. O


* O
nodding O
* O
the O
way O
I O
‚Äôve O
heard O
it O
described O
is O
that O
lasix B-DRUG
is O
sometimes O
a O
Waltz O
& O
sometimes O
a O
tango O
, O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
kidneys O
& O
extra O
fluid O
balance O
. O

The O
good O
thing O
is O
your O
sweet O
Dad O
is O
where O
he O
can O
be O
monitored O
‚ô• O
Ô∏è O
so O
glad O
you O
are O
taking O
a O
few O
moments O
to O
care O
for O
yourself O
. O

Keeping O
you O
both O
in O
my O
prayers O
! O


If O
you O
get O
a O
racing B-ADR
heart I-ADR
, O
sweats B-ADR
, O
shakes B-ADR
or O
other O
types O
of O
body O
anxiety B-ADR
there O
is O
an O
alternative O
to O
benzos B-DRUG
. O

Propanolol B-DRUG
is O
a O
beta O
- O
blocker O
that O
lowers O
your O
heart O
rate O
and O
will O
help O
you O
feel O
more O
in O
control O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
also O
fast O
acting O
and O
not O
sedating O
so O
you O
will O
still O
feel O
alert O
and O
be O
able O
to O
be O
articulate O
. O


I O
also O
just O
tapered O
off O
from O
250 O
mg O
with O
20 O
mg O
prozac B-DRUG
. O

Was O
hell O
but O
nothing O
near O
when O
I O
‚Äôve O
tried O
to O
get O
off O
Effexor B-DRUG
before O
with O
no O
‚Äú O
buffer O
‚Äù O
meds O

I O
have O
had O
this O
happen O
to O
me O
as O
well O
. O

There O
was O
an O
event O
that O
happened O
years O
ago O
that O
I O
was O
n't O
proud O
of O
and O
I O
basically O
had O
completely O
moved O
past O
it O
I O
guess O
. O

Randomly O
a O
year O
ago O
or O
so O
it O
exploded O
into O
view O
and O
I O
went O
on O
this O
obsessive O
spiral O
for O
weeks O
. O



 O
One O
thing O
that O
helped O
me O
for O
a O
bit O
was O
getting O
on O
20 O
- O
40 O
mg O
of O
prozac B-DRUG
. O

I O
am O
no O
longer O
on O
it O
and O
feel O
like O
I O
understand O
OCD B-ADR
quite O
well O
now O
but O
it O
sure O
did O
help O
get O
me O
over O
the O
hump O
. O



 O
I O
would O
highly O
highly O
HIGHLY O
recommend O
doing O
your O
own O
reading O
/ O
research O
on O
OCD B-ADR
as O
well O
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
look O
into O
how O
it O
works O
because O
it O
will O
make O
it O
easier O
to O
deal O
with O
and O
make O
you O
feel O
better O
about O
yourself O
. O



 O
You O
are O
not O
a O
bad O
person O
, O
your O
brain O
just O
has O
an O
overactive O
threat O
response O
. O

Whatever O
you O
have O
done O
in O
life O
trust O
me O
.... O
plenty O
of O
other O
people O
have O
done O
it O
. O

They O
just O
do O
n't O
have O
OCD B-ADR
so O
they O
do O
n't O
get O
devastated O
by O
it O
. O



 O
I O
highly O
recommend O
blogs O
by O
psychiatrist O
etc O
. O

psychology O
today O
as O
some O
good O
articles O
as O
well O
. O


You O
have O
to O
ramp O
up O
to O
an O
effective O
dose O
and O
taper O
off O
when O
you O
stop O
. O

Plus O
it O
's O
a O
gamble O
if O
they O
work O
. O

That O
's O
not O
to O
say O
they O
're O
not O
useful O
, O
I O
'd O
just O
be O
hesitant O
to O
start O
them O
. O

It O
's O
not O
like O
lisinopril B-DRUG
or O
a O
baby O
aspirin B-DRUG
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
both O
work O
in O
advanced O
practice O
medicine O
but O
we O
still O
go O
to O
an O
outside O
provider O
for O
our O
regular O
care O
. O

Even O
though O
she O
could O
write O
me O
a O
prescription O
having O
a O
3rd O
party O
is O
better O
. O


The O
only O
things O
that O
are O
going O
to O
be O
to O
take O
whenever O
you O
‚Äôre O
having O
a O
rough O
time O
are O
propanolol B-DRUG
or O
hydroxyzine B-DRUG
unless O
you O
want O
a O
benzo B-DRUG
and O
if O
you O
want O
one O
of O
those O
my O
recommendation O
would O
be O
klonopin B-DRUG
( O
but O
only O
take O
it O
when O
you O
absolutely O
need O
it O
because O
it O
is O
addictive B-ADR
) O

Lipitor B-DRUG
is O
gon O
na O
give O
them O
heart O
troubles O

Just O
get O
on O
zoloft B-DRUG
and O
adderall B-DRUG

I O
would O
love O
to O
see O
the O
source O
for O
this O
. O

So O
many O
of O
these O
medications O
are O
on O
4 O
$ O
lists O
or O
free O
at O
some O
pharmacies O
. O

Avoid O
Walgreens O
and O
CVS O
. O

Walmart O
, O
Sam O
's O
, O
grocery O
stores O
are O
all O
almost O
always O
substantially O
cheaper O
. O

Amazon O
pharmacy O
is O
fantastic O
. O

Cost O
plus O
is O
good O
at O
well O
but O
more O
limited O
. O

Things O
like O
goodrx O
, O
while O
not O
overly O
reliable O
, O
can O
give O
you O
a O
good O
idea O
of O
alternatives O
local O
to O
you O
. O

Just O
that O
first O
row O
of O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
, O
metformin B-DRUG
, O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
, O
Amlodipine B-DRUG
, O
metoprolol O
should O
all O
be O
under O
4 O
$ O
a O
month O
. O

Atorvastatin B-DRUG
is O
the O
big O
exception O
as O
most O
local O
places O
it O
's O
15 O
$ O

less O

i O
‚Äôm O
even O

my O

not O
the O
aza B-DRUG

The O
important O
thing O
they O
mention O
is O
that O
BTKi O
can O
cross O
the O
BBB O
, O
current O
DMTs O
like O
ocrevus B-DRUG

it O
‚Äôs O

doesn‚Äôt O
impact O

is O
caused O
by O
activated O
microglia O

macrophages O
( O
smouldering O

( O
This O
is O
the O
line O
of O
thinking O
behind O
the O
DODO O
study O
- O
double O
dose O
of O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
for O
2 O

fully O
purge O
the O

The O

  O
When O
I O
was O
talking O

my O
neuro O
recently O
( O
who O

involved O
in O
the O
BTKi O
trials O

he O
was O
saying O
he O
would O
like O
to O
see O
antiCD20 O

BTKi O
given O
, O
as O
the O
antiCD20 O
are O
likely O
better O
at O
targeting O
inflammation B-ADR
that O
originates O
outside O
the O

the O
BTKi O
are O
likely O
going O
to O
prove O
to O
be O
the O
rockstars O
inside O
the O
BBB‚Ä¶.but O
that O
would O
very O
likely O
be O
a O
long O
way O
off O
. O


It O
is O
! O

! O

I O
kinda O
laughed O
at O
this O
because O
this O
is O
definitely O
something O
I O
would O
do O
. O

I O
'm O
nights O
, O
but O
I O
have O
a O
pet O
peeve O
of O
patients O
on O
lasix B-DRUG
with O
electrolyte O
replacement O
ordered O
not O
being O
done O
. O

But O
generally O
I O
do O
n't O
care O
and O
will O
just O
redraw O
and O
do O
it O
and O
let O
them O
know O
what O
I O
found O
out O
the O
next O
day O
. O

That O
3.6 O
K+ O
with O
some O
lasix B-DRUG
will O
be O
much O
lower O
the O
next O
day O
without O
potassium O
. O


Omg O
... O
that O
‚Äôs O
a O
t.e.r.r.i.f.y.i.n.g O

nightmare O

 O
Am O
I O
too O
old O
but O
the O
Pyxis O
, O
I O
used O
last O
, O
opened O
one O
door O
per O
medication O
. O

Like O
if O
you O
wanted O
lasix B-DRUG
, O
only O
the O
lasix B-DRUG
cartridge O
door O
would O
open O
. O

You O
could O
n‚Äôt O
get O
any O
other O
meds O

the O
one O
you O
were O
looking O
for O
. O

Has O
things O
changed O
? O


I O
take O
the O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
at O
8 O
am O
every O
morning O
and O
Metoprolol B-DRUG
right O
before O
bed O
. O

  O
I O
wonder O
if O
taking O
them O
both O
together O
at O
night O
before O
bed O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
as O
I O
typically O
only O
feel O
dizzy B-ADR
during O
the O
day O
. O


I O
'm O
definitely O
interested O
in O
learning O
what O
I O
can O
; O
I O
'm O
awaiting O
a O
diagnosis O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
see O
the O
electrophysiologist O
until O
the O
10th O
... O
the O
normal O
docs O
currently O
have O
me O
on O
both O
Lisinopril B-DRUG
hctz B-DRUG
and O
propanolol B-DRUG
, O
so O
figuring O
out O
dietary O
changes O
has O
been O
a O
nightmare O
in O
the O
interim O
lol O

I O
just O
started O
on O
Prozac B-DRUG
yesterday O
! O

I O
‚Äôll O
ask O
my O
doc O
about O
Pristiq B-DRUG
though O
, O
our O
next O
approach O
is O
Welbutrin B-ADR
but O
I O
‚Äôll O
also O
bring O
up O
trying O
out O
an O
SNRI O
. O

The O
lack O
of O
focus O
, O
pleasure O
and O
motivation O
or O
ability O
to O
finish O
tasks O
makes O
me O
think O
that O
it O
‚Äôs O
dopamine O
- O
related O
but O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
know O
enough O
about O
SNRIs O
to O
know O
what O
they O
usually O
feel O
like O
. O


Posted O
something O
similar O
a O
month O
ago O
and O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
push O
back O
here O
. O

  O
I O
imagine O
it O
‚Äôs O
originally O
a O
cost O
issue O
, O
like O
atorvastatin B-DRUG
and O
rosuvastatin B-DRUG
and O
has O
since O
resolved O
since O
everything O
is O
generic O
but O
I O
‚Äôm O
not O
that O
old O
. O

  O
Agree O
100 O
% O
. O

No O
reason O
to O
use O
HCTZ B-DRUG

It O
does O
absolutely O

for O
drugs O

 O
Imagine O
an O
Atorvastatin B-DRUG
40 O
mg O
tablet O
. O

How O
much O
do O
you O
think O
it O
weighs O
? O

If O
you O
said O
40 O
mg O
you O
‚Äôre O
super O
wrong O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
are O
closer O
to O
200 O
mg O
. O

So O
what O
is O
the O
other O
160 O
mg O
? O

Excipient O
ingredients O
. O

Those O
ingredients O
, O
binders O
, O
preservatives O

colorants O

fillers O
CAN O
BE O
pharmaceutically O
active O
. O

They O
have O
allergen O
risks O
. O

They O
alter O
drug O
absorption O

distribution O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

And O
they O
‚Äôre O
wildly O
different O
between O
manufacturers O

 O
So O
why O
do O
n‚Äôt O
we O
talk O
about O
it O
more O
often O
? O

Pricing O
. O

If O

that O
week O
I O
‚Äôm O
losing O

But O
this O
changes O
all O
the O
time- O
what O
products O
are O
preferred O
with O
the O
warehouse O
or O
distribution O
center O
that O

. O

I O
ca O
n‚Äôt O
promise O
the O

generic O
manufacturer O

your O

Maybe O

maybe O
it O
‚Äôs O
no O

maybe O
the O

way O
too O
high O

 O
So O
we O
lie O

tell O
the O

‚Äú O

honey O
it O

It O
‚Äôs O

We O

But O
what O
can O

? O


Do O
people O
still O
not O
know O
what O
Type O
I O
and O
Type O
II O
Diabetes O
is O
? O


Obesity O
usually O
causes O
Type O
II O
Diabetes O
which O
is O
an O
Insulin O
resistance O
and O
can O
be O
treated O
with O
Metformin B-DRUG
pills O
and O
Trulicity B-DRUG
injections O
for O
example O
( O
plus O
a O
healthy O
diet O
, O
exercise O
, O
etc O
. O

) O
you O
do O
n‚Äôt O
need O
Insulin O
then O
. O


Type O
I O
means O
you O
do O
n‚Äôt O
produce O
any O
sufficient O
amount O
of O
Insulin O
by O
yourself O
anymore O
, O
at O
which O
you O
absolutely O
need O
to O
inject O
it O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
not O
only O
a O
problem O
for O
Obese O
people O
, O
it O
can O
also O
be O
a O
genetic O
issue O
for O
example O
. O


Yes O
, O
a O
healthy O
diet O
is O
necessary O
for O
both O
Types O
of O
Diabetes O
, O
but O
Type O
1 O
does O
n‚Äôt O
go O
away O
, O
people O
need O
the O
Insulin O
no O
matter O
what O
. O

High O
blood O
sugar O
is O
really O
bad O
for O
Type O
2 O
people O
, O
for O
Type O
1 O
people O
it O
‚Äôs O
literally O
deadly O
since O
it O
wo O
n‚Äôt O
regulate O
itself O
anymore O
. O


They O
could O
lose O
limbs O
, O
eyesight O
.. O

I O
drank O
nearly O
every O
day O
when O
I O
was O
on O
Zoloft B-DRUG
and O
I O
‚Äôm O
not O
really O
a O
drinker O
. O

It O
was O
weird O
. O

I O
also O
blacked O
out O
easily O
. O

I O
got O
off O
the O
drug O
a O
year O
ago O
but O
am O
considering O
going O
back O
on O
because O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
is O
really O
bad O
agin O
. O

I O
am O
very O
concerned O
about O
being O
able O
to O
control O
my O
alcohol O
intake O
though O
. O


I O
would O
love O
for O
you O
to O
record O
these O
and O
make O
some O
super O
fun O
pronunciation O
collage O
. O

Cuz O
I O
can O
only O
imagine O
hearing O
the O
mispronunciations O
of O
drugs O
like O
metoprolol B-DRUG
and O
lisinopril B-DRUG
. O


I O
technically O
have O
mild O
crohns O
I O
guess O
. O

But O
was O
going O
to O
the O
bathroom O
10 O
- O
15 O
times O
a O
day O
and O
on O
and O
off O
experiencing O
10/10 O
pain B-ADR
. O

So O
they O
put O
me O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
finally O
. O

Only O
been O
taking O
it O
for O
about O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
so O
far O
. O

Mild O
is O
such O
a O
weird O
term O
. O

Some O
people O
can O
have O
severe O
crohns O
and O
not O
really O
have O
symptoms B-ADR
! O


MDMA O
can O
indeed O
cause O
long O
term O
changes O
in O
some O
cases O
. O

They O
can O
be O
positive O
psychological O
changes O
which O
help O
you O
deal O
with O
past O
trauma O
/ O
hang O
- O
ups O
. O

But O
if O
you O
use O
too O
much O
/ O
too O
often O
the O
neurotoxicity B-ADR
will O
kill O
a O
bunch O
of O
brain O
cells O
and O
do O
other O
shit O
that O
makes O
certain O
areas O
of O
your O
brain O
kind O
of O
" O
crippled B-ADR
" O
for O
years O
. O



 O
Intrusive O
thoughts O
would O
probably O
be O
easier O
to O
deal O
with O
on O
MDMA O
, O
you O
'll O
feel O
super O
confident O
and O
good O
, O
like O
you O
can O
do O
anything O
and O
that O
the O
world O
is O
perfect O
. O

You O
'll O
likely O
not O
have O
any O
intrusive O
thoughts O
or O
easily O
dismiss O
them O
. O



 O
Do O
n't O
take O
MDMA O
on O
prozac B-DRUG
, O
the O
prozac B-DRUG
will O
kill O
the O
MDMA O
's O
effects O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
felt O
way O
better O
than O
Enbrel B-DRUG
did O
for O
me O
. O

Like O
nothing O
happened O
lol O

Hmmm O
you O
could O
try O
another O
ssri O
called O
trintellix B-DRUG
that O
i O
own O
the O
sub O
for O
it O
‚Äôs O
r O
/ O
trintellixssri B-DRUG
or O
try O
prozac B-DRUG
which O
is O
also O
a O
ssri O
. O

things O
you O
could O
also O
try O
are O
propanolol B-DRUG
or O
hydroxyzine B-DRUG
. O

As O
a O
last O
resort O
for O
your O
panic B-ADR
attacks I-ADR
you O
could O
take O
a O
benzo B-DRUG
but O
only O
if O
you O
absolutely O
have O
to O
. O


I O
‚Äôm O
on O
sertraline B-DRUG
( O
Zoloft B-DRUG
) O
! O

I O
first O
tried O
escitalopram B-DRUG
( O
lexapro B-DRUG
) O
and O
it O
did O
help O
overall O
- O
but O
I O
was O
so O
used O
to O
being O
so O
down O
that O
I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
realize O
how O
much O
I O
still O
needed O
help O
. O


Yes O
. O

Idk O
about O
prozac B-DRUG
