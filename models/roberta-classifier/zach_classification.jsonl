{"text":"I'm scrolling through here and I'm actually not seeing any obvious skin ulcerations. I don't know what is going on with her face in some of these photos and I lean towards that being unrelated, but I'm not willing to commit to that 100%. They almost look like scratches? I agree, not picked like Kelly's. Maybe they started as ulcers that she scratched for the photos? They all seem like very fresh blood in the photos, which is just weird.\n\nThe most common place for Beh\u00e7et's ulcerations on women is the legs (perhaps the only thing Kelly got right, haha) and her legs look good in her vacation photos.\n\nI'm still scrolling, but with that being said: she does appear to be malnourished and that is a huge warning sign of GI Beh\u00e7et's. Essentially your GI gets so many ulcers in so much of it, that you no longer absorb the nutrients in your food. Her hair looks thin and shitty for her age, too, which could be caused by that, same for her skin. She really could have it internally and that would explain the surgeries. She also does appear to carry a lot of center weight, which could be bloat or GI-related inflammation, which could be visible due to how thin she is.\n\nThe only thing I'm not catching is if she's on any medication for it? Front line treatment for Beh\u00e7et's is now largely biologics, *however,* they have to be used off-label (there are not enough people with legitimate Beh\u00e7et's diagnoses to run a clinical trial for most biologics to get them formally approved for the disease, albeit Humira did manage to do a first round trial not too long ago for Beh\u00e7et's in Japan). Thus, that could be more of an issue with the NHS rather than her. I'm not in the UK, but I know the NHS has a history with biologics (they've published many articles about how drugs like [Humira were their single, most expensive budget line item](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2018/10/nhs-set-to-save-150-million-by-switching-to-new-versions-of-most-costly-drug/), which tells you all you need to know with how hard it likely is to get them prescribed). I would be curious if she has tried them, or if it has even been offered to her.\n\nIf she has GI Beh\u00e7et's and doesn't have access to the proper treatment, that could explain a lot of what we see and my heart breaks for her if so, even if she's OTT. There's a lot of medications I'm seeing in her feed that don't make any sense for Beh\u00e7et's, though, but I'm going to assume she has other diseases as well.\n\nIf anyone has any good photos of her ulcers, please share! I'll keep scrolling.\n\ntl;dr I mostly agree with you and I think I actually feel for her more than anything.\n\nETA: I clicked on some of the posts and she has some sort of scarring on her legs. Possibly related and if so, I take it back!","_input_hash":1333310042,"_task_hash":-1847487883,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680660310}

{"text":"I am so sorry you\u2019re experiencing so much pain. It is a miserable place to be, as all of us in this sub know too well. Also, congratulations on your baby! I have a few thoughts, which I hope can be helpful.\n\n1. Regarding the neuropathy issues, have you been referred out to see a neurologist? That is unfortunately not a quick fix, but a neurologist might be the best person to help address those issues. A rheumatologist is somewhat outside of their wheelhouse with that. Neurologists can recommend, among other things, medications to help address the pain related to that.\n\n2. If you\u2019re noticing the muscle pain is specific to the period of time immediately following your infusions, I agree with you that this seems important. Once could be a coincidence, but if it is happening over and over, that does significant. I know with Humira I had an \u201cambassador\u201d from Abvie that I could call to ask questions about the medication. Is there anything like that for Remicade? A patient hotline for medication questions? If your doctor doesn\u2019t have answers, it\u2019s worth a shot.\n\n3. Did your doctor mention or discuss the possibility of an allergy to the medication? Just because something didn\u2019t occur in a drug trial doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible for you to experience; clinical trials help but aren\u2019t perfect. It seems that you\u2019re having a decidedly adverse reaction to this medication, whether it\u2019s an allergy or a side effect. I just want to validate that even if your doctor is brushing this off, this is not a typical response. If it is an allergy, you may find your response intensifies with each exposure. If it\u2019s a side effect, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a tolerable one. I think you have every right to persist with your doctor and let them know you\u2019re not tolerating this medication well and ask them what your next steps are.","_input_hash":-18775966,"_task_hash":-2069649581,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680661196}

Some thoughts from me about the methotrexate:\n\n* make sure to ask your doc if they didn't already recommend folic acid. It can help to lessen the side effects of the methotrexate. \n* the science on alcohol and methotrexate seems mixed from my readings. The recommendations I found said that there was increased risk of liver toxicity in people who chronically drank more than the recommended amount. I try to keep my drinks to 1 or 2 a night when i do drink, and i try to take days off from drinking a few times a week. \n* I did crossfit 4x a week for many years, and I continue to lift 5+ days a week with a full time job that i consider at least mentally demanding, a toddler, and a very big property. Your side effects might change depending on your dosage and the rest of your physiology, but I don't see why you couldn't maintain a rigorous lifting schedule. I also find it helpful to do more short sessions per week vs. 2-3 big sessions. This seems to help me keep things limber. \n* I personally feel best when I keep eating throughout the day. Large meals seem to aggravate inflammation for my condition, but it might be different from RA. I've heard that fasting has benefits for inflammation, but I find it hard to be in a \"gain\" mindset and cram all your meals into a smallish period of time. I hate keeping a food journal, but it can be very helpful initially for remembering what you ate the previous day if you wake up feeling bad. \n* I generally shoot for 8 hours of sleep a night.

Over the first year of covid they were reluctant to start new patients on biologics in the UK who had other risk factors so had some steroids which were ok and some DMARD\u2019s which wernt and NSAIDS,  I was then supposed to start a drug trial for \u201cremicade injection pens\u201d about a year after coming off the Humira but I was too old to qualify for the trial so eventually a few months later I went onto \u201cBenepali\u201d a biosimilar of \u201cEnteracept/Enbrel\u201d because the antibody creation risk is lower, which I started about a year ago.\n\nOfficially I should have moved onto \u201cremicade infusions\u201d but they wanted to wait until covid had subsided before adding more people to the transfusion list at my local hospital, so if the Benepali loses its efficacy or I decide I want to I can switch to the infusions which may be more effective.\n\nI was diagnosed very late, my diagnosis path has been used as a UK case study to develop changes in the system to better protect people like myself.

Both companies have a lot to love about them.\n\nThe problem/challenge with healthcare stocks is it can be hard to predict which ones will come up with successful breakthroughs that change things in the future, and also medical patents do expire and that can radically change the future income.  As others have said, ABBV looks better as a near-term investment for a higher yield.\n\nHowever, ABBV's biggest drug - Humira - has a patent expiring in 2023, which means competitors will soon be able to make and sell biosimilar products in the near future.  However, they also have many other big-selling drugs like Skyrizi, Rimvoq and around 90 other smaller ones.\n\nWhen it comes to JNJ, you actually have a more diversified company than Abbvie.  Abbvie spun off from Abbot Labs (ABT) in 2013 where Abbot Labs got to keep all the consumer health product goods while Abbvie got all the pharmaceuticals.  JNJ is still a company that has both in the same company. However, once JNJ completes the spinoff strategy, they will be split into separate companies and people who own JNJ now will have stock in both once the spinoff happens.\n\nAs others have said, you can't really go wrong having both, but ABBV's focus is more narrow and is faster-growing than JNJ.\n\nEdited to add: Disclosure: I'm long JNJ and GILD.

But here\u2019s a silver lining: the earlier you get a diagnosis, the better! And you got yours really early, it took me 10 years! Getting on the right meds can make a world of difference and prevent a lot of damage from occurring, slowing the progression of illness. \n\nThere are a lot of helpful medications out there, and new meds are being developed all the time for autoimmune disorders. Don\u2019t lose hope, just do what you can! Stay as active as possible (which will be much easier since you\u2019re diagnosed and can get actually helpful medications) and that will also help. \n\nAs for your other questions, RA isn\u2019t terminal. It shouldn\u2019t directly affect your life expectancy. Whether or not you\u2019ll lose mobility is related to the severity and progression of your illness, as well as your affected joints. I don\u2019t think most people with RA end up in wheelchairs before they\u2019re elderly, especially if they are taking meds, and not everyone even does. And you also have to remember that a lot of elderly people today didn\u2019t get to start taking modern immunosuppressants/medications when they were 21, so they likely accrued more damage.

No drug company/medical provider will be able to say that a MS drug is absolutely safe without data from a clinical trial to back that claim up, and due to ethical reasons no pregnancy trial will ever be conducted with any MS medication.  This is why every MS medication will have a warning to not get pregnant while on it.  That warning isn\u2019t necessary due to proof the medication will harm a fetus, rather it\u2019s due to a *lack of proof* that it won\u2019t cause harm. \n\nWhat can be done: retrospective studies reviewing cases where women on those DMTs happen to get pregnant; reviewing those pregnancies to see if there are any signals of harmful impact.  This is why the oldest DMT\u2019s are currently the only ones widely used in pregnancy - they\u2019ve been out long enough, and there has been enough observational data collected with no harmful signals that they are generally accepted as \u2018safe in pregnancy\u2019.  \n\nWe all know that birth control isn\u2019t perfect and pregnancies will happen on every DMT at some point.  Ocrevus has been out long enough now that there have been many pregnancies while on it, and so far, no harmful signals have been seen that would indicate it is detrimental, thus many medical providers are feeling more comfortable with their patients getting pregnant while on them. A lot of them still err on the side of caution, recommending getting your infusion, then waiting til month 5 or 6 to get pregnant, and if you get pregnant in that time, wait for your next dose til after pregnancy. If you don\u2019t, then proceed with next infusion, wait several months, and try again.  \n\nIt comes down to trying to balance the risk of further progression (ensuring you are around and able to participate in your child\u2019s life for the long term) with the unknowns around whether or not your DMT will cause harm to your fetus.","_input_hash":-908643417,"_task_hash":-438762318,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680664886}

{"text":"No trouble at all!  And can totally understand the need for wanting to bounce ideas off someone, based on currently available evidence.  My thoughts on your situation: new neuro could very well be correct in the new symptoms being related to stopping the pill/early onset of menopause.  [This paper by Prof G](https://gavingiovannoni.substack.com/p/is-it-ms-or-is-the-menopause?s=r) discusses the impact those hormones can have on our MS.  Additionally, if you are familiar with the [\"leaking pool model of MS\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZPQ48N-nIs&t=166s), it could very well be that these symptoms are caused by damage that were done in the past and are now being revealed due to the extra strain (menopause absolutely counts as an extra strain - the hot flashes raising body temp and roller coaster as a whole).  \n\nLooking at your DMT history, while it's unfortunate you started on Copaxone  & Rebif, that was only for 2 years, and Tysabri is still considered to be in the \"high efficacy\" category.  However, Tyabri's rate of PIRA (confirmed disability worsening without relapse) seems to be \\~double ([24% as per this retrospective study](https://multiple-sclerosis-research.org/2021/11/progression-on-natalizumab/)) that of either O or K ([9.8%/10.9% from their respective trials](https://youtu.be/BVhN4_sEi1s?t=378)).  There is a bit of a difference in PIRA between O and K (at least in the 2 years of trial...but there's no data yet for long term impacts of K on PIRA). That difference it isn't massive though, and it will likely be several years before we get concrete data showing whether or not the difference is statistically significant...right now, it's all theoretical.  It sounds like you're right around the weight that was used to determine the standard dose, so that wouldn't be much of a factor.  In your case, I'm not sure what direction I would ultimately go/how much weight I would give to that 1% difference.  It's like...do I want an ice cream cone with sprinkles, or do I want an ice cream cone with sprinkles & Skor bits.  Both will be delicious, but am I willing to pay extra/go further for the Skor bits?  \n\nRegarding Mavenclad, I did actually discuss it with my neuro last year, and he is quite hesitant to recommend it mainly because after you finish the 2 year course, there's no direction...you stop it and wait to relapse.  At that point, you either do another round of Mavenclad or switch to a different DMT, but new relapse = new damage.  With Ocrevus/Kesimpta/Tysabri/etc, you don't stop and wait for the axe to \\*maybe\\* fall.  He prefers to have his patients on active treatments where you continuously do something to keep MS at bay, not do something then cross your fingers and hope you're in the [\\~50% of patients who remain relapse free up to \\~9.5 years past their last dose](https://www.neurologylive.com/view/cladribine-mavenclad-delaying-ms-conversion-favorable-efficacy-oral-dmts) (similar to aHSCT).  \n\nI tend to agree, seeing as I never fully recovered from the relapse that got me diagnosed (I had had several 'mild' relapses prior to the big one, as evidenced by old lesions & recounting past 'weird' transient things that I had experienced, but the earlier ones we so mild I never thought something might be wrong).  Based on my 2019 relapse where I went from being super active and doing all the things to being unable to function for over a month (husband had to bathe me, dress me, cut up my food and watch me stubbornly try to eat using my left hand because my right hand/arm was dead weight, etc) and the lingering effects from that....I have very low tolerance for more brain damage, and want to preserve every bit I have left.","_input_hash":-398201123,"_task_hash":-2120640620,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680665429}

{"text":">\tWhy don\u2019t they do the double dose as standard treatment? To many side effects? \n\nQuite simply, because this trial hasn\u2019t yet been completed so we don\u2019t yet have evidence of whether this treatment method is superior. \n\nRituxan is dosed based on weight, but when Ocrevus went through the trials, they chose the 600mg dose as the one most likely to fulfill the trial endpoints. \n\nAny medication approved for use has to weigh the risks (in this case, a risk of too much suppression of the immune system, possibly leading to lymphopenia) against the rewards (potentially better overall suppression of MS activity) and then a decision is made whether or not there is enough added benefit to justify the added risk.  Typically the dosage chosen is the lowest dose that gave favourable results. \n\n>\tAlso having in mind that a higher dose penetrates deeper, could we say that the standard dose of ocrevus is better than kesimpta at doing this?\n\nThis possibility of a higher dose penetrating deeper is still in the \u2018theory\u2019 realm, it hasn\u2019t been proven yet whether or not that does happen.

{"text":">\tA PA at my infusion center told me that god decides when we die, so she\u2019s taking her chances.\n\nUgh \ud83d\ude23 this is such a cop out. Basically saying she takes zero responsibility for herself/how her actions impact others.  \n\n>\tCan you help me understand how you came to your decision?\n\nAbsolutely! \n\nIt involved a list of pro/cons, and discussion with my neuro.  He\u2019s well aware of this argument as well, and tends to think very much along the same lines as Prof G, but he reminded me that so far it\u2019s still in the theory phase - trials haven\u2019t been completed yet to prove it out, whether or not it would have a significant impact on PIRA. \n\nMy decision also factored in that I am basically smack dab on the weight that the 600mg of Ocrevus was dosed for (75kg), my B cells have remained at 0 ever since 2 weeks past my loading dose (No early repopulation), and there have been no new/enlarged spots on my MRI.  I also know that a higher dose of O wouldn\u2019t be available to me anytime soon. Basically I viewed these last 3 years as my \u2018induction phase\u2019, and am now *ever so slightly* de-escalating to a lower dose anti CD20.  I also took into account the observational studies that were done on people on Ocrevus who delayed their infusions during COVID in order to hopefully develop a vaccine antibody response, and the result that people who were off for up to ~2 years had only marginally higher relapse rates than those who stayed on O (I know\u2026this is just looking at acute inflammation and not PIRA impacts), along with other studies showing basically that the concentration of O builds up over time (typically the longer you\u2019ve been on a B cell depletor, the longer B cell repopulation takes) so I should essentially have \u2018double coverage\u2019 for some time. \n\nI also do plan to switch to a BTKi once they become available (provided the data are as favourable as anticipated).  \n\nSo it came down to a *possible* slight reduction in impact on PIRA but increased risk of COVID (which I\u2019ve managed to avoid so far\u2026and with what we\u2019re seeing on long COVID, I want none of that!  We have enough brain damage already!), and an entire day spent on the infusion (which completely exhausts me, and I\u2019m generally wiped the rest of the day) \n\nVs\n\nA similarly effective DMT I can self administer each month, with minimal interruption/waiting around/etc, and greatly reduced COVID transmission risk.  Also, Kesimpta does have a shorter half life, so while I know it wouldn\u2019t override Ocrevus right away, if at some point I felt I needed to repopulate B cells in order to have an antibody response to a vaccine, it would likely be a much shorter waiting period. \n\n\nMy veins are also quite stubborn sticks - it\u2019s like a bunch of scar tissue has built up around them, and I almost pass out every time they go to put the IV in - it\u2019s like my veins are greased hogs, and the squirm, slip, and slide to avoid the IV needle penetrating them. And they seem to be getting more difficult each time. It causes a special kind of sensation, completely different from normal needles (which I have no issue with) that gets me all lightheaded, dizzy, blurry vision, with a rushing sound in ears.  Switching to K would preserve my veins for future IV\u2019s, if needed. \n\nI also asked my neuro, if it were him, which would he choose. He said hands down he would choose K, due to the convenience factor.  Known efficacy is very similar.  (Well, his ideal choice would be K + a BTKi, but combining DMT\u2019s is a long way off) \ud83d\ude1d. \n\nAnyway, I kind of rambled there - there were definitely a lot of factors I weighed. Hopefully this helps, even if just to consider from different angles! If I were newly diagnosed, or further from the 75kg weight the dosing was based on (for both K & O) I would likely lean more towards Ocrevus.  I should add that my infusion clinic is ~10min drive away, so that wasn\u2019t a factor.  This whole discussion about switching really started when I mentioned to my neuro that I wanted to do the quick infusion protocol next time, and that\u2019s when he suggested switching to K.  The quick infusion protocol had its drawbacks too - usually it takes til the end of the normal 5-6 hrs for me to feel comfortable driving (due to Benadryl), so if I did the quick protocol, my husband would need to take time off work drive me (which he was totally willing to do\u2026but it\u2019s a hassle).","_input_hash":1644080575,"_task_hash":-158644154,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680665594}

{"text":"Hello there! As a five year veteran of the psychic wars, I can tell you from first-hand experience that Sertraline might well have saved my life. Early on in my college years, I was diagnosed with OCD following a general collapse of my mental well-being. At the end of my Undergraduate years of College, I suffered what is often called a 'mental breakdown', though this is a term that needs to be taken with more than a pinch.\n\nWhile I had been resistant to taking drugs to help my condition (I have both OCD and ASD) , I eventually realised, that the waves of intrusive thoughts were breaking me down and making a 'normal and productive' life impossible.  I was first put on Fluoxetine (50mg), but this did very little. In fact, it arguably made my condition worse and led to what felt like full-blown depression (again, don't want to overhype my experience).\n\nSertraline has helped clear my mind and lower my general skittishness. Though I'm on a relatively low dosage (50mg), it has been enough to empower me to combat anxieties and intrusive thoughts with relative ease. It's not a cure-all, but it is one of the reasons that help me live a productive life (even through and after lockdown).","_input_hash":1798160790,"_task_hash":-1184998650,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1680666347}

{"text":"Oh my please talk to your doctor. \n\nIt sounds like you jumped up too quickly. Manic episodes can be a side effect with antidepressants. You may need to switch. \n\nI have MDD/GAD/ADHD. My Father had bipolar so there\u2019s always the risk antidepressants could cause a manic episode in me, but that hasn\u2019t happened yet. \n\nPersonally it took me six weeks at 5mg Lexapro before I could tolerate doubling my dose to 10mg. I was tired, nauseous, and dizzy. \n\nJust like we are warned to slowly taper off Lexapro, I personally think we should taper on.\n\nIf you\u2019re able to just ease your body into taking Lexapro, try 2.5mg by splitting a 5mg pill. Do that for one week. Take the Lexapro in the early evening/close to bedtime so you can sleep through side effects. \n\nThen if you\u2019re doing ok on 2.5mg for one week, start the next week with alternate days on 2.5mg M/W/F/Su and 5mg Tu/Thur/Sat. Keep that up as long as you think you can tolerate it. \n\nIf that feels ok, and there are no new or dangers side effects, then do one or more weeks at 5mg a day. Then follow that with alternating 5mg and 7.5mg for a week or more. \n\nThen the following weeks alternate with 7.5mg and 10mg until you feel you can tolerate 10mg daily. \n\nAlthough the commons therapeutic dose is 10mg, some people cannot handle that. Each body is different. I have friends on 30mg even though that\u2019s above the 20mg maximum recommended dose. \n\nFor me personally Lexapro helped my anxiety but didn\u2019t do too much for my depression, and it also exacerbated my ADHD symptoms. Which is how they realized I had ADHD. \n\nI was switched off Lexapro and moved to Prozac. 20mg Prozac is more activating and I did not feel tired from it.

(I know, I\u2019ve been there).\n\nIt sort of sounds like the only thing your doctors have offered you to help you get pregnant is telling you to lose weight. Is that true? If so, that\u2019s some bs. People with PCOS have an even harder time than usual losing weight, and humans in general are not designed to lose weight and keep it off, and rarely successful at it.\n\nYou deserve ACTUAL medical care. For me, letrozole was very effective. It took about 4-5 months to get up to the correct dose to make me ovulate. Then once we got to the right dose, I got pregnant twice, two cycles in a row. (The first was a miscarriage, the second is my 2 year old). It was also reasonably cheap. I don\u2019t recall how much we paid, but I think insurance covered part of it, and the rest was like\u2026 less than $100 a month for generic. And, fyi, I recently learned that my regular obgyn can prescribe letrozole, I didn\u2019t actually need the expensive reproductive endocrinologist to prescribe it, though after 3-4 years, you probably want to do diagnostic testing to confirm if there is an issue besides ovulation.\n\nThis time (trying to get pregnant), I have diabetes, and was put on metformin. That is making my PCOS better enough that I ovulate by myself. It\u2019s also super cheap. With insurance, like\u2026 under $10 for generic for a 3 month supply.\n\nClomid and letrozole (and sometimes metformin) often work really  well for people with pcos.

{"text":"This topic has come up several times. Here's a good [summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/5pz321/medical_tripsmedical_missions/)\n\nJust going to quote the comment from u/Anothershad0w\n\n> Here's why missions get a bad rap:\n> \n> 1.) People do them when they have very little clinical experience. When it comes to med school admissions, your clinical experience is the foundation for your app. Since you're applying for US schools, you need US clinical experience. If a significant portion of your hours are from volunteer trips, it looks bad.\n> \n> 2.) People use them as an excuse to do things they are not qualified to do. I see this all the time. A premed brags about the baby they delivered in Africa, but med schools see this as taking advantage of people in bad situations for your own personal education (and your experience is educationally worthless, anyway). Building your resume at the expense of the health of a patient looks bad, believe it or not.\n> \n> 3.) The significance of the trip. This shows up in your essays and interviews. Basically, don't do the savior complex thing. You didn't single handedly save a village of women and children by giving them beta blockers and metformin. Don't pretend you did. Avoid cliches. Be honest about your motivations and what you got from the experience. You aren't going to fool anyone, and if you try, it will look REALLY bad.\n> \n> 4.) Quality varies. If you go on a weeklong trip and spend 4 days on a beach, you just took a vacation, not a medical mission trip. Stay true to the goal of the trip. Adcoms have seen more apps than days you have been alive, they can judge these things well.\n> \n> I personally went on two medical missions - one as a member and another as the trip leader. I had significant other clinical experience, demonstrated interest in global health prior to my mission trips, and my app was strong without the trip. It was a very valuable experience which I feel that I described well on my essays and in my interviews. I did quite well in getting interviews and had a 100% post-interview acceptance rate if coming off the waitlist counts.\n> \n> So, in summary these trips, in contrast to what is parroted around here from SDN can be valuable experiences, or they can hurt. They are NOT supposed to be the foundation of your app, nor your clinical experience.","_input_hash":-2022776683,"_task_hash":643870333,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680668981}

So if you have the feeling that your Ob/Gyn is not open for a second opinion consider going to another ob/Gyn that is open for medication like Spironolactone and/or Metformin. If they do not give you a recipe themself (what is fine if they do not know the stuff) they should at least give advice how to get a doctor who may be able to. \n\nI hope you find the help you need! And I am really sorry that our health system does not offer a modern and easy treatment. I am a health economist so these things like dealing with doctors come more easy to me but I can imagine that it's very hard to find guidance in our system especially if you are maybe (?) not a native speaker as it is already complicated.","_input_hash":272857758,"_task_hash":-1521098275,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680669417}

Not only does it help control blood sugar and reduce insulin resistance the way metformin does, it also helps reduce inflammation, lower cholesterol, improve egg quality, curb hunger and reduce sugar cravings. All of this can also help indirectly with hyperandrogenism driven by insulin resistance.\n\nIt can cause headaches and digestive issues at first, so you might want to ease into it.

If you're already on Lexapro, adding Wellbutrin should help. It will at least give you energy and a slight mood boost. There are better options (mainly MAOIs) but you can't use them if you are already on an SSRI, and it might not be wise to stop taking that in your current state. \n\nDo you know if you have access to Ketamine therapy or Parnate where you live?","_input_hash":-1812441037,"_task_hash":-1673198613,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680669618}

I've taken as much as 2.7g per day in the past and never really gotten any of the anxiety-quelling effects.    \n\n    \nThe thing that I have noticed with Gabapentin is that it takes a fairly long time to actually work for my nerve pain.

{"text":"I was on 60 mg propanolol very briefly, only took it 3 times but I felt like I got some adrenal rebound for weeks after I quit. I can't imagine how bad a cold turkey would be after long term use.\n\nSadly, I think your CNS just gets more and more sensitive, the more you change up drugs. I messed up mine badly over the last 3 months. Right now I'm so sensitive that I took benadryl for allergies for 3 days and then when I stopped I got withdrawals and now I'm tapering that. Totally ridiculous, I used to be able to take any drug in the world and now I can't take a benadryl? But else what can I do?\n\nI'm also now learning that all pills are risky, the less I take the better. If I'd simply taken nothing since the start of my withdrawals, I'd probably be better than having taken all the stuff I tried to fix it. I'm also learning that the less changes I make, and the slower I make those changes, the better I feel.\n\nYou know the site survivingantidepressants? Look at their forums and look at people's signatures and the way they quit each and every med very slowly over a few years. That's probably going to be your journey. I think you'll have an unstable period where you find the right mix of meds to feel pretty good on, and then do the long tapering from there and stay stable while you take less and less.\n\nKlonopin withdrawal is a tricky one in that it will creep up on you. Like you'll stop taking it and you'll feel fine and then 4-5 days in maybe your sleep gets worse and 6-7 days in your heart starts pounding and you've got a lot of adrenaline and you finally realize you're in withdrawal.\n\nLike, you might get lucky and find out you're not dependent at all. And then you're done with it, that'd be great. But you might find out a week later that you're in klonopin withdrawal and you basically just quit cold turkey, it just hasn't hit yet.  Then you would need to either go through a month of bad symptoms or go back on it and restabilize.\n\nBasically, there's some risk in how you're testing it. It might work out, if you're lucky and didn't get addicted, it might not. You at least need to have a plan in mind for what you're going to do/take if it doesn't work out.","_input_hash":1262985461,"_task_hash":-995056313,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1680669787}

{"text":"You are polydrugged, so many different things going on.\n\nYou're going to have to fix this one step at a time, by tapering off some of the drugs and leaving the few that work for you. Maybe eventually you get off all of them some day, but for now the goal should be just getting down to a few that work and make your life better.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\nYou're taking too much mirtazapine. That drug works better for sleep at low doses, like 15 mg. At higher doses, it's more stimulating. Maybe if you use it for depression, you need the higher doses. But you're on an SSRI for depression. So you don't need it. Go lower with the mirtazapine. If you've been on it a while, that might have to be a slow taper. If you've just started, you might be able to go quickly.\n\nYou don't need both lunesta and klonopin. Pick one or the other. It sounds like you already picked the klonopin and you're working off the lunesta.\n\nLunesta withdrawal can cause some unexpected stuff. Insomnia for sure, but another one is leg cramps. If you get those out of the blue, that means you're going too fast with the lunesta. But maybe you won't get them because you're on the klonopin?\n\nI can't tell you how dependent you are on klonopin. Some people can go on and off without withdrawal. Some people have horrible withdrawals. If you're taking them more than half the days, you're probably already addicted. I would definitely not increase the dose you take per day. Taking them more days per week will make you a little more addicted, I'm not sure it matters much either way. You will eventually have to figure out how to taper off them and that will be rough when it happens. But hopefully you've solved some of the other issues before then.\n\nYou said you're tapering propanolol? How much are you on right now? You might want to keep that stable while you work on the other issues. I don't know, I'd have to think about it.\n\nI don't know SSRI's very well. Different ones work better or worse for different people. Maybe Pristiq isn't one the one for you and you can find a better one. The one good thing is that doctors will prescribe SSRI's for years, so maybe if you can control anxiety with that, you can take less of the other drugs.","_input_hash":-377835905,"_task_hash":-709099027,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1680669871}

{"text":"Ohh!!! This is literally my favorite subject and my favorite receptor :)\n\nAre you sure that reducing 5-HT1A autoreceptor is what you want? FYI, autoreceptors work like brake cables so activating it essentially causes the opposite response (result looks more like an antagonist) and visa-versa.\n\nAcutely, nah, depending on what you mean? Buspirone (debatably) or any antagonist should do this. Propanolol in another, albeit lesser known option. You can find databases online. Any antagonist will reduce activation but you need to check whether it is presynaptic (autoreceptor) selective. Most agents acting on this receptor are preferential to the autoreceptor. SSRIs will do this with chronic administration.  But, be mindful on the fact that when we antagonize this receptor, there will be upregulation going forward. That being said, even though this is a homeostatic feedback system, excessive activation of postsynaptic (heteroreceptors) does NOT always result in adaptive changes to the presynaptic even though you'd think it would. Chronic activity at the presynaptic like I believe Addy (HPPD drug no one has heard of) has should really in downregulation. You can look into Befiradol (in trials currently) and 5-ht1a biased agonism for more info on this.\n\nFeel free to ask me follow-up questions if you have any or want more detail than that!

If you follow the link, it advocates the use of propanolol as a treatment for gender dysphoria.\n\nI want to make this abundantly clear: there is NO evidence that propanolol is an effective treatment for gender dysphoria.\n\nPropanolol is a type of medication called a beta blocker. It functions to reduce heart rate. There are some preliminary studies that it can treat panic episodes from anxiety by lowering the elevated heart rate that accompanies panic attacks, or preventing the heart rate from spiking. It is NOT curative in these cases.\n\nTaking any medication without medical supervision is dangerous. I could also see this medication exacerbating dysphoria in some cases. My personal response to dysphoria was dissociation/depersonalization, which is typically accompanied by a reduction in heart rate. This medication would probably only exacerbate dysphoria in my case.\n\nI understand how difficult it is to cope with dysphoria.

{"text":"10mg is the lowest dose of lisinopril used when managing hypertension, or high blood pressure. It sounds as though after using the medication, and some lifestyle changes, your BP has come back down to a *normal*, healthy value. (Firstly, really well done. A lot of people don't ever get their BP completely under control - you've done yourself a huge favour in the long run).\n\nIt's almost completely impossible to say whether this correction is due to the meds alone, your lifestyle alone, or (more likely), a combination of the two. \n\nGiven that your BP isn't high anymore, I don't think it would be unreasonable to have a trial period without the medication, and to monitor your blood pressure to see if it goes back up. However, this is something that should always be done under the supervision of a physician, and with their knowledge and recommendation. It would 100% be worth asking your Dr when you speak to them in a few months time. \n\nGiven that you're on the lowest dose, you won't have to ween yourself off, it'll just be a case of stopping it. You're unlikely to experience any symptoms when you miss a dose, as a) missing one day won't affect your blood pressure hugely, it's a change more seen over time, and b) unless very high, blood pressure doesn't carry symptoms - people just know about it when things start to go wrong (i.e. strokes and heart attacks). \n\nSo yeah, that's a long way of saying that a trial period without the meds wouldn't do you any harm, but you should talk to your Dr first and get their advice as they'll know you 100x better than any of us will. \n\nAll the best.","_input_hash":999243801,"_task_hash":354398523,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680748493}

Yes, that *might* mean everyone has to wear a mask or maybe it means we have to get better vaccines or vaccine uptake - not sure what will work, but it MIGHT have to be an extreme measure - we should be ready for that reality. \n\nBut the way things are trending, where society is unwilling to vaccinate anymore, unwilling to be collective in its action against covid - i don't see any path forward other than recommending everyone who is not a senior right now to just go ahead and consider retiring early, in your 40s if you can - you will regret waiting until 67, seeing as how people are planning to address the covid risk - you will not want to be older + retired when the next variant/pandemic/climate change hits. You'll be wasting your retirement years, possibly living in fear until you die.\n\n\n**Edit:** For those of you who think I'm downplaying the loss of the 2 years of pandemic hurting younger people - you are missing the point. \n\nThe point is not to downplay the current loss. My point is that you have already lost the today time - *and in addition* - because of how we are using that time to combat collective crisis (poorly), you will also lose future time. You are paying, for nothing. It is a detriment to you today AND tomorrow. They took 2 dollars from you today, and will have spent it to not solve the problem and tomorrow they will take another 2 dollars. If we don't get it together and solve this problem for all people, we are all going to get old and suffer again.","_input_hash":-171698053,"_task_hash":-2033115853,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680748909}

They couldn\u2019t stent the LAD because the blockage was too far away to reach with their tools, and they didn\u2019t do the RCA because they felt the risks outweighed the benefits. I take 80 mg of Lipitor per day, and it\u2019s so effective that the last time I had a cardiac catheterization, the cardiologist thought I was mistaken about the blockages that had been diagnosed two years previously. It wasn\u2019t until be saw my previous scans that he believed I really had been blocked up that bad.

Sometimes, for some drugs, that might be the brand name drug but most drugs are now available as generic versions from alternative manufacturers. There are some circumstances where a particular brand version is required rather than a generic in which case the brand name is prescribed but in those circumstances the doctor must usually provide a clinical reason/rationale for the requirement. It's often due to patient reactions to ingredients/excipients which differ between brand and generic preparations due to manufacturing differences.","_input_hash":247805557,"_task_hash":1573145161,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680749338}

{"text":"It's delay of execution to my view.  One of the effects of Simvastatin (and Atorvastatin) is that it increases the deformability of the red blood cells.  This way they can squeeze through narrow spaces easier.\n\nOn top it aids in reducing clotting.  \n\nBut neither the deformability nor the anticoagulant effects will reduce damage to the endothelium.  The 4S study was done with a median follow up of 5.4 years.  I can only wonder by how much it delays the event.  You may win a couple of years if would die from your event but those couple of years are likely spent in a diseased state so I wouldn't recommend anyone to continue with a crappy lifestyle and take simvastatin to 'protect' you.  It won't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We also found that simvastatin increases deformability by acting directly on the membrane in the absence of the liver, and that ATP release was increased for cells with enriched cholesterol after treatment with simvastatin.\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026286212000465?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026286212000465?via%3Dihub)\n\nand consistent with the clot forming theory of Malcolm Kendrick, we also find Simvastatin to be an anticoagulant\n\n>Using a model of microvascular injury, which reflects TF-initiated blood coagulation,32,33 we have demonstrated37\u201339 that simvastatin 20 to 40 mg/d depresses thrombin generation in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. We found that at the site of hemostatic plug formation, depletion of prothrombin was reduced by 16%, whereas the rate of formation of prothrombin activation products, such as F1.2, prethrombin 2 (residues 274 to 579), and thrombin B-chain, was decreased by 27% and the time of their appearance was delayed by \u224860 seconds in hypercholesterolemic subjects receiving simvastatin.39 This latter finding is consistent with the concept of a statin-induced reduction in TF expression in various cells involved in the hemostatic process because the duration of the initiation phase of blood coagulation (also termed the \u201clag phase\u201d) largely depends on the activity of the TF\u2013FVIIa complex.40 All these anticoagulant effects of simvastatin were independent of changes in lipid profile.\n\n[https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.atv.0000151647.14923.ec](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.atv.0000151647.14923.ec)","_input_hash":-824556174,"_task_hash":-124809394,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1680749379}

That also seems a bit better. My heart rate when I take BP seems ok though higher than before all of this (mostly in 70s). My main issue is the dang BP which I cannot get under control. And I have some insomnia with may be part vaccine and part med. Doctors will keep trying other meds to see what might work. Hoping for the best. Dealing with alot of anxiety out of all of this.

{"text":"I\u2019m on Leflunomide, an immunosuppressant similar to Methotrexate (except doses daily not weekly), with the primary goal of reducing joint pain. Too early to tell if it\u2019s working as it\u2019s only been 2 weeks. However, I\u2019m hopeful, as I was on it for 6 weeks late last year, got no side effects, and realized it was starting to help once I was pulled off of it.\n\nI chose Leflunomide over Methotrexate as the potential most common side effects of Methotrexate (fatigue and nausea, although often just on the dosing day) would be much more bothersome for me than with Leflunomide (primarily diarrhea), and they have similar effectiveness. Leflunomide has a higher chance of elevating liver enzymes, but they monitor that, and any lasting damage after stopping the med is rare.\n\nPlaquenil / Hydroxychloroquine is the first med tried for the vast majority of patients, and was for me, but I couldn\u2019t tolerate it. I\u2019ve read that in patients without organ damage, usually the Plaquenil is given time to work (up to 6 months) before deciding to add something else. If tolerated, patients are typically kept on it, adding other meds if needed. Many patients don\u2019t need any other med.\n\nI\u2019ve also been given a Prednisone (steroid) taper for flares. Usually rheums don\u2019t like to use them long term as there are a lot of bad long term effects. Sometimes they are used medium term while waiting for another med to kick in. Or long term in very low doses.\n\nLupus specific meds aren\u2019t an option for me at this time at least, as my official diagnosis is UCTD, with Lupus as only a verbal diagnosis, so insurance won\u2019t cover them. But there are some newer options like Benlysta.\n\nTreatment should be tailored to the patient, so what others take may not be what you need. Talk to your doctor about your symptoms, treatment options, and what symptoms the treatment may help. Treatment choice depends on your symptoms, their severity, what you\u2019re currently taking (if any), how long you\u2019ve been on it, potential side effects, lifestyle, cost/insurance, etc.","_input_hash":298592267,"_task_hash":1904923092,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"accept","_timestamp":1680751058}

Were it not for me being 100% remote at work I would have had to give up trying to control it earlier and went on meds.

{"text":"First of all, good job hanging in there after what sounds like a very difficult time with your baby being sick and going through a regression.. I wholeheartedly feel your exhaustion DEEPLY and want to tell you what a good job you\u2019re doing. \n\nI just started Zoloft for ppd at 8.5 months pp. My little guy has been an awful sleeper from the get-go. PPD showed up as anger/rage for me and for me it just got worse over time unfortunately (also all the other typical signs - social isolation, lack of interest in anything, feeling like my baby was better off with another more stable mom). Maybe this isn\u2019t the case for you, it\u2019s so hard to say with all the factors involved.. sleep deprivation is a literal form of torture and takes your mind to scary places. It\u2019s so hard too when you can\u2019t get a break. \n\nKeep an eye on it. Make an appointment with your doctor and they will give you a test called the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to put a number on your symptoms. My therapist did this with me and repeats it every few weeks to see how I\u2019m doing. Incase you want to feel it out for yourself here\u2019s the scale \n\nhttp://www.perinatalservicesbc.ca/health-professionals/professional-resources/health-promo/edinburgh-postnatal-depression-scale-(epds)\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve probably done it before as it sounds like you had ppd with your first. Anyways, I\u2019m feeling less angry and ragey since starting Zoloft even with my level of sleep deprivation. It\u2019s helping to stabilize my mood and I don\u2019t immediately turn to anger, I feel more patient and empathetic which is more like myself. \n\nIt\u2019s so hard. Hang in there, and please don\u2019t feel embarrassed. We understand here and please know that you aren\u2019t being judged. Anger and rage are some of the top symptoms of ppd (as told to me by my therapist and doctor).","_input_hash":1467813615,"_task_hash":-1934030068,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680752823}

Feel free to PM me if you want to stay in touch. I wish I had had someone with PMDD to assure me that even when the lows come, they will absolutely not last. Edit to add: take the benzos if you need them. I didn\u2019t take one until last month and my god I felt normal finally.

{"text":"Heart attack- an artery to the heart gets blocked, often by a cholesterol plaque, causing part of the heart muscle to die. This is often called a STEMI and people go to the cath lab (fancy, not as intense OR) for a stent, which is a hollow tube (initially collapsed) that gets tunneled through the plaque and then forced open, shoving the plaque out of the way of the blood.\n\n\nHeart failure has MANY different flavors, the main branches of which are reduced ejection fraction and preserved ejection fraction (EF). First, let me state the EF of a healthy heart is 60%. NOT 100%. Whatever number you're told, always compare it to 60.\n\nThey'll determine the EF using an echocardiogram or \"echo.\" Remember the ultrasounds you got when you were pregnant? It's the same, but for the heart, not the baby. Cold jelly on the chest and taking a bunch of pictures. This will likely be done at bedside. Though there are both the right and left sides of the heart we typically only talk about the left side - the side that sends blood to the body.\n\nReduced EF- the heart has problems in systole, the squeezing portion of the cycle. This would be an EF less than 60%. The management and medications will change depending on how low the EF is. The heart isn't squeezing enough blood to the body, the patient may be dizzy, weak, short of breath, easily fatigued. The chest X-ray may look junky because, if the heart isn't pumping out well enough, the lungs get back up.\n\nPreserved EF- the heart has problems in diastole, the relaxation portion of the cycle. The EF is often normal (60) or higher. Let's say, for example, a healthy heart takes in 100 mL of blood with each beat. It puts out 60% of that, or 60 mL. Now, a preserved EF heart may only be able to relax enough to take in 80 mL of blood. 60% of that is 48 mL. Ultimately, the effect remains the same: not enough blood to the body. Dizziness, weakness, shortness of breath.\n\nI'll just throw out the fact that people can have combined systolic and diastolic heart failure. Just for completeness. No need to fuss with it.\n\nIf heart failure gets bad enough, that backed up fluid in the lungs can back up more to the legs. Poke his legs. Does your finger print stay? That's (can be) caused by heart failure. A lot of heart failure management is fluid management. Fluid pill (to make him pee), maybe fluid restriction, and weighing himself - every day, same time, same clothes (or naked).\n\nOther management is focused on what caused the heart failure. High blood pressure? BP meds. Aortic stenosis (valve from the heart to the body has trouble opening)? Maybe we talk about replacement. Prior heart attack? Let's see if we can help the heart be efficient.\n\nLet's talk about drugs.\n\n\"Pressors\"- a catchall phrase for medications that keep a patient's blood pressure up. The fewer the better, but needing them initially isn't the end of the world.\n\nFluid pill/lasix- meds to make him pee. With the heart not working like it should, the fluid we naturally take in isn't getting to the kidneys as often as it should. Instead, this pill will force the kidneys to be extra effective.\n\nBeta blockers- not given during the critical phase of heart failure, but will likely be started before discharge. B-blockers do a couple of things: slow the heart (more time to fill with blood to pump to the body), decrease blood pressure (less strain on the heart. High BP means the heart has to struggle  against the blood already existing in the vessels to get the newly oxygenated blood pushed forward out of the heart), and they decrease the force with which the heart contracts (less strain on the heart. May seem like a contradiction, since one may imagine you'd want every drop off blood pumped out possible, but the heart isn't like an arm work out. There are no rest days. We don't want it going 100% all the time. So we help the heart to chill.) B-blockers are proven to reduce mortality.\n\nACEs and ARBs- do the same thing in slightly different ways. You get one or the other. They decrease BP, help the kidneys, prevent heart remodeling, and also have proven mortality benefits. Not everyone with heart failure needs these.\n\nStatins- cholesterol meds. There is a score on the computer that the docs will plug your husband's numbers into to see if he needs these.\n\nWhy'd your husband need CPR?\nAnything that causes heart failure can distort the structure of the heart. The muscle being stretched/thickened/scarred can interfere with the electrical signals causing an arrhythmia. Some arrhythmias just don't work (V tach, V fib). So he went down.\n\nOther arrhythmias\n\nPatients with heart failure sometimes get a rhythm called a fib. (Lots of people without heart failure have it, too.) If it's too fast it can be a problem but if it's a funny rhythm at a generally acceptable speed then it's fine. Lots of people live with it. They do need anticoagulants (blood thinners), though. The rhythm allows blood to sit in the heart and clots can form because it's not flowing perfectly. So, blood thinners. This may be why they want to check for a stroke.\n\n\nThis is a lot. There's so many \"if this then thats\" that'd it'd be overwhelming to talk about. This should give you the slightly-more-than-basics and we can chat and fill in the gaps as you and your docs learn more.","_input_hash":979692886,"_task_hash":1639083471,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680753678}

{"text":"I had zero complications up until after labor, other than many months of preterm contractions that kept fooling my docs (and me) into thinking it was real labor. Normal HR, BP.  I had shortness of breath laying down, but what mamma doesn't when she's 9 months pregnant? I was fatigued and my feet were swollen, but again, how could you tell the difference? \n\n5 days after labor my lungs started filling with liquid and I could hear soda fizzing noises with each exhalation and my ankles/feet were still very swollen. I got it checked out and my HR was 40, my BP was 190/100, and my heart was failing (echocardiogram confirmed). Fortunately, it wasn't bad failure and I'm just a handful of percentage points away from the bottom of the normal range for ejection fraction (the official measurement used to diagnose heart failure)... and water pills have gotten rid of the water. \n\nI tried hydralazine and water pills (furosemide) for 5 weeks to see if it was enough to help get BP back down while the heart healed itself because those two meds are breastfeeding friendly. It didn't help. I've been taking carvedilol (a beta blocker that reduces BP and HR and adrenaline generally) and Losartan to reduce BP and help repair heart muscle fibers.  They are not BF friendly, so I stopped breastfeeding/pumping at 5 weeks.   \n\n7 months later there has been minimal improvement in my ejection fraction, but I don't feel as completely smashed. I couldn't go up the stairs without a break and heart pounding before, and now I can climb the stairs at least 12 times a day without issue. The two cardiac drugs most effective for HF both have the side effect of fatigue, so that's fun to add to heart failure fatigue and normal baby sleep deprivation. \n\nIt can take up to 12 months to recover, and most cardiologists will want to keep you on the cardiac meds for at least 12 months, even if you recover sooner. Assuming you recover fully, there is about a 20-30% it will happen again in future pregnancies, and possibly worse (20-30% depending on which studies you read).  If you don't recover fully, it's a big risk to carry a pregnancy to term.  I don't plan on any more babies for that reason.","_input_hash":-467509188,"_task_hash":895767449,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680754253}

It's not just about \"rent cost vs mortgage cost\". People sometimes ignore property tax, maintenance costs, realtor fees, and time costs. People very often forget the opportunity cost of not investing. The math is not so simple. You have to figure out what you are most likely to return if you instead invest what you would have used as a downpayment and any difference between rent vs mortgage and housing costs. You have to assume you use whatever tax vehicles / programs are available to you in either approach. You have to consider your own behaviours and discipline, debt tolerance, and credit access. You have to consider the rental vs property market in your destination including how much equity may increase (not really precictable) and any rent control laws. You have to consider if you are likely to move, especially if your relationship status were to change. \n\nSome simplify this to the 5% rule - https://youtu.be/Uwl3-jBNEd4.

Too many syringes is a recipe for a mix up even if you label them.","_input_hash":-2133026252,"_task_hash":-278153354,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680754569}

{"text":"I have reported it the other time I witnessed something like that. The pt was still at home, her like, 39 year old son lived there too and stayed in his room, honest to God, playing VIDEO GAMES, had a portable fridge in there. He was her only caregiver besides hospice visits. Truly he had a neck beard and his room STANK for no reason. He was perfectly physically capable. Well, in the end he just stopped taking care of her. He'd call us for \"emergency\" visits and get there to see she just needed to be changed and he'd yell from his room \"will you get her some food from the kitchen?\" Kitchen was a mess.. but the worst WORST was the day I reported... She was on huge doses of lasix. Her bed had like 20 chux under her which were all soaked in tea colored urine and he was refusing a catheter!  She had wounds in her pitted legs that were wrapped IN CHUX and taped to deal with the weeping, his idea of wound care he didn't want her to go to a snf. And all the other nurses were just saying yes sir.(which is a whole nother story about sometimes hospices are yes men because of their bottom line and I do think it's Well intentioned but misplaced). \n\n Well I just told him \"I'm giving her a catheter and if you argue with me I'm calling APS.\" As soon as I got her cathed , about 1000ml returned of tea colored urine and it was forcefully draining. Poor thing was trying to hold it. Filled the bag and kept going as I drained it into a bucket. When the CNA and I tried to clean her and turn her she was screaming in pain so, YA THINK he was taking her morphine??? \n\nAs soon as I left I called our NP and said \"if you don't call APS , I will\".

{"text":"So I have it based on genetic means aka idiopathic. I know, it doesn't make sense but it's how neuros define it. I didn't respond to any of the meds that well. Only one I did respond to was lasix. I was going blind and things were getting worse. I had my VP shunt and stent placed last year and have been in remission since. Honestly a shunt might be your only option if you don't respond to lasix. I was an athlete majority of my life so when I started gaining weight out of nowhere it did freak me out and concern me greatly. This disease isn't picky. It chooses who it wants based off pure chaos. I'm discovering that IIH might not be as rare as we are told it is. With so many people having similar symptoms and being dismissed by the medical system I wouldn't be surprised if it moves up to uncommon. I don't think IIH is strictly a woman's disease. I think it's one that can be caused by so many variants that we still don't know. \nJust take a breather and try to calm down. I recommend getting a therapist to help you cope. It's saved me a lot, especially having a therapist that's disabled too. Having someone help guide you through some of the hardest points in your life can be a literal life saver. If you need any resources to find one that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, let me know and I can help you out.","_input_hash":-84640715,"_task_hash":-1181340391,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680754721}
{"text":"This doesn't necessarily fit with all of the symptoms you listed, but are you sure you don't have diabetes? Have you ever been tested for it?\n\nThe only thing that has helped me for dizziness--and I have been to a lot of doctors--is when the neurologist prescribed Clonazepam/Klonopin 1 mg. I hate to say that, because that's a drug you don't want to take every day or long term since it's addictive. I was very careful about how I took it so that I wouldn't have issues. I've also been prescribed Furosemide, which is a diuretic that helps sometimes but not completely. I am someone who loves salt, though, so Furosemide is good for that. \n\nI am also possibly thinking of possible nerve issues in relation to your symptoms, but I don't really know much about how those are discovered/diagnosed.\n\nIt's interesting you mention anxiety. I have a theory that a lot of us who have had Meniere's mentioned to us or who are suspicious that we have it actually have overactive/overstimulated nerves or nervous systems. Yours might not be causing you anxiety symptoms anymore, but maybe it's still causing issues with dizziness and other issues. I have mild anxiety and experience dizziness pretty much daily (I can still function and work, though), and my mother also has anxiety and gets dizzy at times. So, I am curious if a different class of anxiety medication would help with your dizziness, like an anticonvulsant like Klonopin.

{"text":"I say this a lot. For several different reasons. But the most important thing to emphasize is this \"what the fuck were they thinking\" conversation actually needs to be a conversation rather than a rant / temper tantrum. I had an attending that would say this repeatedly; it was more of a decision paralysis fixation because they didn't know what to do, and this was their signal they wanted someone else to take the reins from them.\n\nA - Sometimes what they did makes perfect sense, I just didn't know it was an acceptable or effective treatment. By asking this seemingly dumb question out loud, sometimes a random pharmacist will pipe up and tell me what they did is more or less an acceptable standard of care. \n\nB - I actually do need to know why they did something if it turns out to have potentially caused harm, and also what they were trying to do or thought they were dealing with. Both in order to know how to address and fix it, and also how to frame my documentation. \n\nC - I probably know the other physicians involved, might even have gone to residency together. I'm trying to give them an audible benefit of the doubt because I don't want to believe that I've also made mistakes of the same, or bigger caliber, but never knew. In this scenario \"what the fuck were they thinking\" is almost more of a prayer than a question.\n\nD - More than all the other reasons, EMRs universally are dogshit. If the patient was doing well and things were handled they wouldn't have been transferred. The patient is now critically ill and I have to make absolutely sure the initial diagnosis was correct, which is rarely the case. If I'm talking to myself and say, did the outside ER really give this guy with a potassium of 9, 40mg of lasix and thoughts and prayers, then sit on it for four hours then send it here? Someone might very well pipe up and say something like \"oh no, transfers from Backwoods Regional Best County Hospital have a handwritten med order page for verbal orders, down at the bottom of the pile. That used to throw me off too.\" This might also be a lightbulb moment, and may lead to finding out that the patient has been, say, taking his 40mg lisinopril PRN Q1H for headaches and his #30 prescription from Friday is now empty. \n\nIn summary, learning from other people's mistakes is the absolute best form of learning from mistakes. But it's not as intuitive, so as part of the process you have to muddle through it, trying to understand their frame of mind at the time. It's honestly more of a teaching yourself methodology than the classic, distilled crystalized wisdom received from the lords of internal medicine after being humbled by the most merciless pimping session ever witnessed west of the Mississippi.","_input_hash":335658093,"_task_hash":-1077088286,"label":"ADR","_view_id":"classification","answer":"reject","_timestamp":1680754785}
