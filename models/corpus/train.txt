I O
get O
guttate O
psoriasis B-ADR
wet O
I O
use O
antibodic O
. O

It O
goes O
away O
a O
couple O
weeks O
after O
. O

I O
think O
it O
fucks O
my O
guts O
flora O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
makes O
my O
pso O
disapeared O
. O


MS B-ADR
symptoms O
pre O
- O
date O
PsA O
diagnosis O
so O
humira B-DRUG
did O
n't O
cause O
it O
but O
there O
is O
a O
link O
of O
biologics O
worsening O
MS B-ADR
so O
it O
did O
likely O
progress O
it O
some O
. O



 O
In O
2007 O
I O
went O
to O
the O
doctor O
with O
loss B-ADR
of I-ADR
feeling I-ADR
in O
my O
toes O
and O
very O
sore B-ADR
joints I-ADR
. O

I O
point O
blank O
asked O
if O
I O
had O
PsA O
because O
of O
the O
humira B-DRUG
commercials O
. O

University O
doc O
told O
me O
I O
was O
stressed O
( O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
) O
and O
wore O
shoes O
that O
were O
too O
tight O
( O
toes O
) O
because O
the O
numbness B-ADR
, O
and O
i O
quote O
, O
would O
be O
a O
concern O
for O
MS B-ADR
but O
you O
are O
too O
young O
( O
i O
was O
26 O
) O
. O

I O
never O
regained O
feeling O
my O
toes O
. O



 O
2011 O
i O
went O
to O
the O
ER O
because O
i O
lost B-ADR
feeling I-ADR
from O
my O
head O
to O
hips O
on O
my O
right O
side O
only O
. O

They O
confirmed O
I O
was O
n't O
have O
a O
stroke B-ADR
and O
the O
doctor O
literally O
shrugged O
and O
said O
" O
weird O
stuff O
just O
happens O
" O
. O

I O
regained O
sensation O
in O
every O
but O
my O
fingers O
tips O
of O
my O
right O
hand O
within O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O



 O
2012 O
I O
broke O
down O
crying O
at O
my O
GP O
about O
hurting B-ADR
everywhere O
but O
that O
I O
had O
been O
told O
it O
was O
stress O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
feel O
stressed B-ADR
and O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
full O
feeling O
of O
my O
toes O
and O
right O
hand O
fingers O
. O

NOTHING O
was O
done O
for O
MS B-ADR
symptoms O
but O
my O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
landed O
me O
at O
a O
rheumatologist O
by O
2013 O
. O

Once O
diagnosed O
with O
PsA O
I O
just O
lumped O
the O
numbness B-ADR
in O
as O
a O
symptom O
and O
carried O
on O
. O



 O
Feb O
2019 O
I O
fell O
on O
ice O
and O
I O
fell O
hard O
. O

It O
set O
off O
a O
big O
flare B-ADR
of O
inflammation B-ADR
. O

Like O
my O
knees O
hurt B-ADR
so O
bad O
a O
week O
later O
I O
almost O
threw O
up O
. O

The O
fall O
did O
n't O
hurt O
much O
, O
but O
after O
did O
. O

About O
one O
week O
after O
I O
noticed O
that O
when O
I O
looked O
down O
at O
my O
feet O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
getting O
electrocuted O
( O
Lhermitte B-ADR
's I-ADR
sign O
) O
and O
I O
thought O
I O
damaged O
my O
spine O
in O
the O
fall O
. O

My O
current O
GP O
ordered O
and O
MRI O
of O
spine O
and O
there O
were O
lesions O
. O

I O
was O
blind O
sided O
by O
the O
query O
of O
MS B-ADR
. O

Completely O
shocked O
. O

That O
led O
to O
brain O
MRI O
, O
more O
lesions O
, O
and O
off O
to O
an O
MS B-ADR
clinic O
I O
went O
. O



 O
I O
brought O
detailed O
notes O
to O
my O
neurologist O
about O
all O
the O
stuff O
above O
and O
he O
was O
so O
happy O
that O
I O
did O
that O
because O
it O
really O
makes O
the O
case O
that O
the O
MS O
was O
n't O
just O
from O
humira B-DRUG
and O
had O
been O
around O
for O
awhile O


 O
So O
folks O
, O
numbness B-ADR
is O
never O
normal O
. O


No O
I O
’ve O
been O
too O
afraid O
to O
try O
any O
of O
them O
so O
far O
! O

Basically O
for O
my O
autoimmune O
condition O
you O
can O
do O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
Cellcept B-DRUG
, O
Cyclosporine B-DRUG
, O
or O
maybe O
Tacrolimus B-DRUG
. O

And O
then O
Humira B-DRUG
if O
your O
insurance O
approves O
it O
. O

The O
other O
option O
is O
steroids O
, O
which O
I O
’ve O
been O
doing O
for O
now O
( O
localized O
though O
, O
not O
systematic O
) O

Thanks O
for O
this O
. O

It O
does O
seem O
like O
most O
people O
are O
pretty O
happy O
once O
they O
get O
to O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
stage O
. O

It O
’s O
just O
scary O
to O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
methotrexate B-DRUG
/ O
cellcept B-DRUG
state O
first O
before O
insurance O
plays O
along O
. O

I O
’m O
still O
probably O
going O
to O
try O
to O
hold O
off O
as O
long O
as O
I O
can O
because O
of O
the O
pandemic O
and O
people O
being O
so O
awful O
to O
immunocompromised O
people O
but O
who O
knows O
what O
’s O
next O
. O


It O
took O
me O
6 O
months O
to O
improve O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
8 O
months O
for O
insurance O
to O
interrupt O
my O
treatment O
causing O
me O
to O
build O
antibodies O
. O



 O
And O
that O
's O
one O
of O
the O
many O
reasons O
I O
fled O
America O
. O


Huh O
so O
I O
stand O
corrected O
! O

! O

My O
rheum O
said O
that O
and O
I O
just O
believed O
him O
as O
Cimzia B-DRUG
is O
a O
much O
smaller O
drug O
, O
bout O
a O
quarter O
to O
a O
third O
of O
the O
size O
of O
other O
biologics O
like O
humira B-DRUG
or O
inflixumab B-DRUG
. O



 O
But O
the O
frequently O
of O
anti O
- O
cimzia B-DRUG
antibodies O
is O
lower O
than O
for O
other O
tnfa O
inhibitors- O
only O
about O
6 O
% O
of O
AS O
patients O
get O
antibodies O
in O
this O
drug O

The O
pharmacist O
would O
definitely O
be O
able O
to O
give O
reliable O
info O
about O
whether O
Paxlovid B-DRUG
interacts O
dangerously O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
but O
that O
's O
not O
really O
the O
question O
: O
  O
It O
's O
whether O
Paxlovid B-DRUG
is O
less O
effective O
for O
people O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

  O
I O
'm O
not O
so O
sure O
a O
pharmacist O
would O
know O
the O
answer O
to O
that O
, O
or O
be O
able O
to O
look O
it O
up O
. O


He O
would O
sleep O
within O
20 O
minutes O
of O
taking O
Taltz B-DRUG
and O
humira B-DRUG
and O
sleep O
for O
more O
than O
a O
full O
day O
. O

Chronic O

n’t I-ADR

very O
bad O

and O

Very O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
your O
advice O
& O
suggestions O
! O

! O

I O
was O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
before O
and O
I O
got O
so O
irregular O
with O
the O
medication O
, O
so O
I O
’m O
gon O
na O
try O
it O
again O
after O
a O
session O
or O
two O
of O
accutane B-DRUG
! O


I O
echo O
your O
pain B-ADR
. O

Humira B-DRUG
worked O
for O
me O
until O
it O
did O
n’t O
. O

Just O
starting O
Cosyntex B-DRUG
( O
sp O
? O

) O
. O

  O
Praying O
for O
all O
of O
us O

I O
’m O
in O
the O
same O
boat O
the O
only O
difference O
is O
I O
had O
my O
second O
Humira B-DRUG
shot O
on O
Monday O
first O
shot O
helped O
for O
about O
five O
days O
I O
felt O
almost O
like O
my O
old O
self O
. O

  O
Second O
injection O
zero O
results O
i O
’m O
flaring B-ADR
pretty O
bad O
and O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
’s O
failing O
me O
. O

Did O
it O
work O
for O
you O
right O
away O
or O
took O
some O
time O
? O


I O
hope O
you O
've O
followed O
up O
with O
your O
gastro O
. O

I O
'm O
on O
biologics O
my O
CRP O
is O
down O
a O
lot O
but O
I O
might O
be O
on O
a O
mini O
flare B-ADR
getting O
a O
CT O
tomorrow O
🤞 O
. O

But O
biologics O
do O
help O
alot O
I O
'm O
taking O
humira B-DRUG
I O
also O
have O
Crohns O
btw O
. O

Biologics O
are O
expensive O
though O
so O
hopefully O
you O
have O
good O
insurance O
abvie O
does O
have O
a O
financial O
aid O
program O
though O

When O
I O
was O
on O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
the O
first O
doses O
I O
noticed O
I O
suddenly O
had O
more O
energy O
. O

I O
felt O
a O
lot O
better O
from O
an O
energy O
standpoint O
while O
I O
was O
on O
it O
. O

Later O
when O
the O
doctor O
wanted O
to O
try O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
see O
if O
it O
would O
cure O
my O
skin B-ADR
issues I-ADR
as O
well O
( O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
) O
the O
fatigue B-ADR
came O
back O
and O
remained O
despite O
switching O
immediately O
to O
Remicade B-DRUG
and O
years O
later O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
. O



 O
So O
I O
think O
the O
TL;DR O
answer O
is O
: O
It O
could O
help O
with O
the O
fatigue B-ADR
. O

It O
depends O
on O
how O
you O
react O
to O
the O
particular O
medication O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
a O
biologic O
is O
self O
injected O
at O
home O
. O



 O
Immunosuppressants O
like O
methotrexate B-DRUG
are O
not O
as O
safe O
as O
biologics O
. O

  O
There O
is O
quite O
a O
cost O
difference O
also O
. O


All O
the O
more O
reason O
to O
have O
the O
decision O
be O
between O
a O
doctor O
and O
a O
patient O
. O



 O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
this O
was O
specifically O
about O
biologic O
drugs O
, O
thanks O
for O
the O
info O
! O

My O
mum O
takes O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
's O
been O
life O
changing O
- O
but O
she O
had O
to O
try O
a O
few O
others O
over O
the O
years O
and O
had O
some O
nasty O
side O
effects O
on O
other O
types O
. O



 O
I O
'd O
worry O
swapping O
out O
for O
a O
biosimilar O
might O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
different O
side O
effects O
or O
changes O
in O
efficacy O
. O



 O
They O
are O
truly O
miraculous O
drugs O
, O
without O
Humira B-DRUG
my O
mum O
was O
heading O
for O
needing O
a O
wheelchair O
, O
but O
the O
body O
's O
response O
to O
them O
can O
be O
so O
unpredictable O
. O


Hi O
! O

I O
have O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
over O
a O
year O
now O
and O
I O
have O
to O
actually O
get O
off O
it O
despite O
it O
helping O
my O
HS O
. O

I O
developed O
drug O
induced O
lupus B-ADR
, O
super O
fun O
. O

We O
are O
actually O
switching O
me O
to O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
, O
which O
is O
in O
clinical O
trials O
for O
HS O
currently O
, O
soon O
to O
be O
approved O
I O
believe O
last O
I O
heard O
. O

I O
’m O
switching O
to O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
also O
because O
I O
have O
psoriatic B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
that O
is O
not B-ADR
responding I-ADR
to O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
well O
either O
. O

Just O
wanted O
to O
share O
another O
potential O
option O
to O
look O
into O
too O
! O


Not O
currently O
but O
it O
has O
done O
many O
times O
before O
, O
drs O
were O
always O
shocked O
that O
I O
kept O
my O
hair O
and O
nails O
when O
I O
was O
younger O
as O
I O
was O
about O
85 O
% O
covered O
. O

I O
have O
n’t O
had O
skyrizi B-DRUG
, O
I O
’ve O
reacted O
badly O
to O
the O
il-23 O
blockers O
I O
’ve O
tried O
( O
stelara B-DRUG
, O
tremfya B-DRUG
) O
after O
tremfya B-DRUG
I O
wo O
n’t O
try O
another O
of O
that O
type O
, O
I O
honestly O
feel O
I O
would O
’ve O
died O
had O
I O
stayed O
on O
that O
, O
il-17 O
blockers O
I O
react O
to O
as O
well O
, O
Taltz B-DRUG
made O
half O
my O
hair B-ADR
fall I-ADR
out I-ADR
, O
luckily O
I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
lol O
the O
only O
one O
I O
really O
got O
on O
with O
was O
humira B-DRUG
but O
it O
failed O
after O
2 O
years O
. O

Listen O
to O
your O
body O
when O
on O
these O
biologics O
, O
I O
listened O
to O
drs O
for O
far O
to O
long O
that O
it O
was O
n’t O
the O
tremfya B-DRUG
that O
was O
making O
my O
body O
feel O
like O
it O
was O
shutting O
down O
, O
I O
’d O
lost B-ADR
over I-ADR
4 I-ADR
stone I-ADR
, O
my O
skin B-ADR
was I-ADR
grey I-ADR
, O
I O
had B-ADR
no I-ADR
energy I-ADR
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
, O
my O
whole B-ADR
body I-ADR
was O
in O
pain B-ADR
. O

For O
2 O
years O
they O
tested O
me O
for O
all O
sorts O
until O
I O
decided O
I O
was O
n’t O
listening O
anymore O
and O
stopped O
the O
injection O
, O
my O
health O
has O
been O
on O
the O
up O
ever O
since O
so O
take O
advice O
from O
the O
drs O
but O
always O
trust O
your O
own O
instincts O
x O

It O
took O
6 O
- O
8 O
months O
for O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
even O
start O
working O
. O

Full O
year O
before O
I O
was O
completely O
out O
of O
bed O
every O
day O
. O

Give O
it O
a O
little O
more O
time O
. O


Yep O
, O
doctor O
mentioned O
oral O
pills O
, O
but O
said O
those O
are O
less O
effective O
and O
have O
more O
side O
effects O
than O
the O
biologics O
. O

  O
She O
said O
we O
were O
probably O
looking O
at O
Humira B-DRUG
or O
Remicade B-DRUG
. O



 O
Allergy B-ADR
food O
sensitivity O
test O
is O
a O
great O
idea O
! O

  O
I O
had O
downloaded O
a O
app O
on O
his O
phone O
last O
week O
that O
he O
could O
use O
to O
track O
food O
and O
BMs O
so O
we O
could O
have O
data O
for O
when O
we O
met O
with O
GI O
, O
but O
we O
got O
into O
the O
GI O
faster O
than O
anticipated O
so O
we O
naturally O
did O
n’t O
have O
much O
, O
but O
we O
’ve O
got O
that O
started O
. O

 

 O
He O
was O
already O
in O
therapy O
for O
anxiety B-ADR
, O
but O
now O
I O
am O
wondering O
if O
these O
stomach B-ADR
issues I-ADR
were O
sort O
of O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
anxiety B-ADR
? O

  O
Either O
way O
we O
have O
more O
data O
to O
give O
his O
current O
therapist O
, O
and O
the O
GI O
has O
sent O
a O
referral O
to O
a O
therapist O
they O
work O
with O
that O
specializes O
in O
this O
, O
so O
cool O
. O

 

 O
So O
, O
sounds O
like O
we O
have O
sort O
of O
a O
good O
start O
. O

  O
Now O
it O
’s O
onto O
processing O
what O
this O
means O
for O
the O
future O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
has O
helped O
me O
immensely O
.. O
I O
also O
had O
frequent O
bouts O
of O
uveitis B-ADR
which O
have O
completely O
stopped O
. O



 O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
my O
chronic O
back O
and O
neck B-ADR
pain I-ADR
was O
related O
to O
uveitis B-ADR
or O
inflammation B-ADR
until O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
ago O
. O



 O
I O
was O
getting O
steroid B-DRUG
injections O
in O
my O
low O
back O
and O
it O
was O
n’t O
until O
my O
doc O
injected O
my O
SI O
joint O
instead O
of O
L4 O
and O
L5 O
that O
I O
had O
major O
relief O
. O

This O
lead O
to O
a O
rheumatologist O
referral O
and O
weekly O
treatment O
with O
humira B-DRUG
and O
meloxicam B-DRUG
as O
well O
. O



 O
Now O
my O
back O
and O
neck B-ADR
pain I-ADR
have O
been O
reduced O
by O
leaps O
and O
bounds O
and O
I O
am O
no O
longer O
worried O
about O
impending O
blindness B-ADR
from O
uveitis B-ADR
or O
the O
steroid O
eye O
drops O
causing O
cataracts B-ADR
. O



 O
Life O
is O
much O
better O
for O
me O
after O
diagnosis O
.. O
It O
’s O
not O
perfect O
but O
I O
am O
no O
longer O
in O
pain B-ADR
, O
grumpy O
and O
missing O
out O
on O
life O
and O
that O
is O
everything O
. O


i O
ve O
been O
on O
cosentyx B-DRUG
two O
different O
times O
. O

currently O
still O
on O
it O
, O
about O
3 O
- O
4 O
months O
in O
? O

i O
was O
about O
70 O
% O
covered O
, O
now O
i O
m O
about O
98 O
% O
clear O
! O

highly O
recommend O
esp O
if O
your O
insurance O
covers O
it O
. O

my O
fingernails O
are O
clearing O
up O
too O
. O

fwiw O
i O
ve O
also O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
stelara B-DRUG
but O
they O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
for O
me O

Oh O
that O
’s O
awesome O
! O

  O
Yeah O
, O
I O
’ve O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
6 O
years O
now O
and O
it O
’s O
been O
extremely O
effective O
for O
me O
. O

  O
Still O
some O
side O
effects O
, O
but O
nothing O
compared O
to O
the O
alternative O
. O

  O
The O
oral O
pills O
were O
something O
I O
was O
very O
eager O
to O
get O
off O
of O
, O
it O
can O
become O
exhausting O
taking O
12 O
pills O
a O
day O
and O
it O
definitely O
changes O
your O
outlook O
on O
what O
it O
even O
means O
to O
be O
“ O
living O
” O
. O

  O
But O
that O
’s O
great O
that O
y’ O
all O
started O
a O
journal O
, O
so O
many O
apps O
out O
there O
to O
help O
track O
, O
make O
it O
easier O
and O
a O
little O
less O
overwhelming O
… O
usually O
the O
doctor O
will O
give O
a O
list O
of O
foods O
to O
avoid O
or O
potential O
triggers O
as O
well O
to O
help O
guide O
you O
. O



 O
With O
regards O
to O
the O
food O
sensitivity O
, O
I O
know O
some O
people O
who O
found O
it O
to O
be O
EXTREMELY O
helpful O
and O
others O
that O
did O
n’t O
learn O
much O
. O

  O
The O
point O
being O
that O
at O
least O
it O
’s O
something O
that O
can O
give O
you O
more O
knowledge O
to O
help O
your O
son O
navigate O
this O
disease O
as O
best O
you O
can O
… O
especially O
when O
it O
starts O
to O
seem O
like O
there O
’s O
no O
rhyme O
or O
reason O
to O
any O
of O
it O
. O

  O
But O
obviously O
not O
for O
everyone O
. O

 

 O
I O
’m O
also O
someone O
who O
wanted O
to O
try O
as O
many O
natural O
supplemental O
( O
so O
in O
addition O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
) O
treatments O
as O
possible O
to O
help O
me O
maintain O
this O
disease O
and O
my O
parents O
were O
very O
supportive O
in O
that O
decision O
. O

  O
That O
being O
said O
definitely O
try O
/ O
talk O
to O
your O
doctor O
about O
yoga O
, O
pre O
/ O
probiotics O
, O
CBD O
, O
meditation O
… O
the O
inversions O
from O
yoga O
can O
help O
with O
gut O
health O
and O
pain B-ADR
relief O
... O
  O
Pro O
/ O
prebiotics O
help O
to O
regulate O
your O
guts O

… O
CBD O
interacts O
with O
your O
Endocannabinoid O
system O
which O
has O
a O
plethora O
of O
effects O
and O
meditation O
helps O
to O
train O
your O
mind O
which O
as O
you O
know O
is O
an O
incredibly O
crucial O
skill O
regardless O
of O
the O
diagnosis O
, O
but O
the O
breathing O
patterns O
actually O
help O
me O
when O
I O
do O
experience O
pain B-ADR
or O
discomfort B-ADR
. O

  O
The O
gut O
is O
known O
as O
the O
second O
brain O
for O
a O
reason O
, O
and O
it O
’s O
connectedness O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
our O
body O
plays O
a O
huge O
role O

live O
his O
“ O

good O

happy O

I O
’ve O
got O
the O
same O
on O
my O
inner O
thighs O
and O
my O
bf O
did O
n’t O
even O
notice O
until O
one O
popped O
one O
day O
and O
I O
needed O
him O
to O
get O
me O
bandaids O
and O
stuff O
to O
clean O
it O
up O
. O

Get O
to O
a O
dermatologist O
and O
see O
if O
they O
can O
prescribe O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

That O
might O
help O

What O
is O
Humira B-DRUG
used O
for O
? O


A O
quick O
search O
tells O
me O
it O
costs O
  O
13000 O
NOK O
( O
1300 O
USD O
) O
per O
mL. O

However O
it O
also O
says O
this O
is O
only O
given O
with O
an O
" O
H O
" O
, O
prescription O
, O
which O
means O
the O
hospital O
pays O
it O
, O
in O
line O
with O
other O
medications O
you O
get O
while O
in O
a O
hospital O

aka O
a O
Norwegian O
would O
never O
see O
this O
cost O

Write O
a O
letter O
to O
your O
representatives O
/ O
the O
President O
with O
this O
story O

It O
’s O
worth O
a O
try O
😭 O
I O
’m O
guessing O
the O
5 O
dollars O
a O
shot O
was O
with O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
copay O
assistance O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
think O
of O
is O
to O
try O
getting O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
through O
Costco O
. O

My O
dad O
just O
retired O
and O
one O
of O
his O
expensive O
drugs O
cost O
much O
less O
than O
everywhere O
else O
through O
them O

[ O
deleted O

I O
have O
advice O

I O
am O
starting O
Humira B-DRUG
next O
week O
and O
feel O
very O
nervous O
as O
well O
. O

I O
hope O
it O
helps O
us O
both O
without O
side O
effects O
. O

Sending O
hugs O

I O
was O
on O
a O
short O
course O
Remicade B-DRUG
( O
similar O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
) O
for O
a O
few O
months O
back O
in O
the O
mid O
2000 O
’s O
, O
and O
it O
definitely O
put O
my O
HS O
into O
remission O
for O
a O
few O
years O
. O

But O
a O
longer O
course O
was O
n’t O
recommended O
at O
the O
time O
, O
doctors O
nowadays O
have O
recommended O
spiro O
over O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
I O
’d O
be O
reluctant O
to O
take O
an O
immunosuppressant O
during O
a O
pandemic O
anyway O
. O



 O
Spiro B-DRUG
has O
no O
noticeable O
effect O
on O
my O
dysphoria B-ADR
. O

It O
has O
no O
gender O
- O
based O
effects O
for O
me O
at O
all O
. O

When O
I O
started O
, O
I O
did O
have O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
dizziness B-ADR
( O
spiro B-DRUG
is O
often O
prescribed O
to O
lower B-ADR
blood I-ADR
pressure I-ADR
) O
that O
was O
extreme O
enough O
it O
took O
me O
a O
few O
months O
to O
very O
slowly O
ramp O
up O
to O
this O
dosage O
( O
150mg O
/ O
day O
, O
though O
most O
people O
with O
HS O
see O
enough O
effects O
at O
100 O
mg O
) O
. O

And O
I O
continue O
to O
have O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
needing B-ADR
to I-ADR
pee I-ADR
more O
often O
. O

My O
dysphoria B-ADR
is O
around O
my O
hair O
( O
managed O
by O

it O
fashion O
colors O
) O
and O
breasts O
, O
neither O
of O
which O
are O
affected O
physically O
by O
spiro B-DRUG

I O
just O
started O
weekly O
after O
a O
decade O
of O
biweekly O
. O

If O
in O
the O
US O
be O
mindful O
of O
what O
insurance O
covers O
. O

FDA O
approved O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
biweekly O
only O
for O
AS O
, O
but O
weekly O
for O
RA O
oddly O
enough O
. O

Your O

may O
not O
cover O

doses O

Currently O
on O
year O
2 O
with O
Entyvio B-DRUG
and O
so O
far O
so O
good O
. O


I O
definitely O
do O
think O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
helped O
, O
that O
’s O
when O
I O
noticed O
I O
was O
having O
less O
and O
less O
symptoms O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
has O
given O
me O
a O
quality O
of O
life O
and O
mental O
outlook O
back O
that O
I O
lost O
10 O
years O

 O
I O

not O

the O

every O
night O
, O
I O
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
shower O
standing O
up O
without O
pain B-ADR
or O
fear O
of O
falling O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
a O
few O
years O
. O



 O
Since O
beginning O
Humira B-DRUG
I O
’ve O
managed O
to O
run O
- O
and O
realise O
I O
love O
it O
. O



 O
I O
’ve O
gotten O
back O
into O
education O
and O
began O
applying O
to O
work O
. O

I O
sleep O
better O
. O

I O
’ve O
started O
cooking O
and O
seeing O
( O
vaccinated O
) O
people O
more O
. O

My O
interpersonal O
issues O
and O
personal O
trauma O
has O
gotten O
more O
bearable O
because O
I O
’m O
not O
in O
constant O
pain B-ADR
, O
sleep B-ADR
deprivation I-ADR
, O
and O
inflammation B-ADR
induced O
stress O
. O



 O
This O
disease O
can O
be O
hell O
but O
when O
you O
find O
a O
drug O
that O
works O
for O
you O
, O
the O
relief O
is O
unbelievable O
. O

It O
feels O
like O
living O
again- O
which O
is O
horrible O
to O
be O
deprived O
of O
but O
something O
I O
’m O
constantly O
grateful O
for O
in O
a O
way O
no O
non O
- O
disabled O
person O
would O
be O
able O
to O
feel O
. O


There O
is O
a O
chance O
that O
Crohns O
can O
go O
into O
remission O
without O
any O
intervention O
, O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
clinical O
trials O
amongst O
other O
sources O
. O

I O
think O
all O
the O
people O
claiming O
to O
have O
cured O
or O
helped O
their O
Crohns O
with O
diets O
or O
alternative O
treatments O
were O
just O
the O
lucky O
ones O
that O
went O
into O
remission O
naturally O
and O
they O
just O
attribute O
it O
to O
whatever O
“ O
treatment O
” O
or O
diet O
they O
were O
trying O
at O
the O
time O
. O


I O
had O
uveitis B-ADR
before O
I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
then O
I O
also O
had O
refractory O
uveitis B-ADR
while O
on O
humira B-DRUG
. O

The O
course O
of O
action O
is O
to O
calmly O
alert O
your O
providers O
, O
seek O
an O
exam O
, O
and O
expect O
to O
be O
prescribed O
pred O
eyedrops O
. O

I O
am O
still O
going O
through O
routine O
flare O
ups O
of O
uveitis B-ADR
, O
and O
the O
steroids O
are O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
band O
aid O
cure O
while O
I O
also O
try O
to O
maintain O
remission O
of O
all O
symptoms O
with O
biologics O
. O



 O
If O
your O
swelling B-ADR
goes O
down O
before O
being O
examined O
, O
be O
adamant O
in O
advocating O
for O
yourself O
and O
what O
you O
experienced O
. O

Describing O
that O
there O
was O
no O
gritty O
sensation O
will O
dispel O
there O
urge O
to O
write O
off O
as O
pink O
eye O
. O

Describing O
the O
dryness O
and O
blurriness O
will O
be O
helpful O
, O
and O
the O
intermittent O
nature O
of O
its O
occurrence O
. O



 O
Ill O
offer O
a O
more O
calming O
take O
than O
some O
others O
here O
, O
that O
the O
blindness B-ADR
would O
be O
a O
remote O
risk O
but O
still O
certainly O
the O
reason O
to O
be O
checked O
out O
. O


I O
will O
for O
sure O
have O
some O
berries O
and O
nuts O
! O

I O
'll O
look O
into O
Humira B-DRUG
as O
well O
. O


I O
tried O
it O
for O
a O
year O
and O
never O
reached O
remission O
. O

The O
billing O
was O
also O
a O
pain B-ADR
. O

On O
humira B-DRUG
now O
for O
almost O
3 O
years O
and O
in O
remission O

How O
long O
have O
you O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
? O

And O
do O
you O
take O
it O
for O
RA O
? O


Humira B-DRUG
is O
one O
of O
the O
treatments O
for O
Crohn O
's O
so O
it O
should O
be O
helping O
if O
that O
's O
what O
you O
have O
. O

 

 O
A O
colonoscopy O
is O
the O
usual O
test O
that O
gives O
a O
clear O
diagnosis O
, O
so O
if O
that O
has O
n't O
been O
done O
, O
it O
should O
be O
on O
the O
list O
. O

 

 O
Blood O
when O
wiping O
can O
just O
be O
due O
to O
wiping O
a O
bunch O
. O

  O
A O
bidet O
and O
letting O
things O
air O
out O
more O
can O
help O
a O
bunch O
. O


That O
's O
great O
- O
and O
I O
also O
experienced O
dramatic O
improvement O
after O
going O
grain O
- O
free O
. O

Everyone O
is O
different O
. O

But O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
PsA O
does O
n't O
just O
attack O
your O
joints O
, O
it O
eventually O
attacks O
your O
organs O
, O
leaving O
you O
more O
vulnerable O
to O
heart B-ADR
attack I-ADR
or O
stroke B-ADR
. O

I O
can O
understand O
not O
wanting O
to O
be O
on O
a O
heavy O
duty O
drug O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
I O
hope O
the O
dietary O
change O
is O
all O
you O
need O
. O

For O
me O
, O
the O
improvement O
going O
gluten O
free O
lasted O
well O
over O
a O
year O
, O
but O
eventually O
my O
symptoms O
did O
return O
, O
and O
I O
went O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Unfortunately O
I O
later O
developed O
a O
medical O
condition O
that O
makes O
it O
impossible O
for O
me O
to O
take O
biologic O
drugs O
. O


Merck O
's O
entire O
pipeline O
could O
fall O
by O
the O
wayside O
, O
and O
Keytruda B-DRUG
would O
probably O
keep O
the O
ship O
afloat O
for O
another O
7 O
or O
8 O
years O
. O

 


 O
Ultimately O
, O
these O
things O
are O
more O
dependent O
on O
the O
payer O
( O
Medicare O
/ O
insurance O
) O
than O
anything O
. O

But O
, O
we O
should O
get O
a O
good O
idea O
in O
2023 O
on O
how O
biosimilars O
of O
a O
blockbuster O
drug O
are O
going O
to O
work O
in O
the O
real O
world O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
( O
Abbvie O
) O
. O

 


 O
There O
's O
6 O
or O
7 O
Humira B-DRUG
biosimilars O
that O
should O
be O
available O
by O
end O
of O
2023 O
, O
but O
only O
one O
afaik O
that O
is O
interchangeable O
( O
June O
- O
ish O
) O
. O


Otelza O
takes O
16 O
weeks O
to O
start O
working O
for O
rashes O
longer O
for O
joint O
issues O
. O

I O
knew O
that O
starting O
it O
but O
it O
has O
fewer O
nasty O
side O
effects O
than O
some O
of O
the O
biologics O
eg O
humira B-DRUG
and O
tnf O
inhibitors O
can O
rarely O
lead O
to O
cancer B-ADR
or O
ms B-ADR
( O
demyelination B-ADR
) O
. O

My O
dr O
wants O
to O
reevaluate O
in O
3 O
months O
and O
if O
no O
improvement O
wants O
to O
switch O
to O
something O
else O
. O

Reading O
on O
these O
boards O
you O
’ll O
see O
meds O
diet O
etc O
are O
not O
a O
one O
size O
fits O
all O
. O

One O
med O
can O
work O
amazing O
for O
someone O
and O
does O
nothing O
for O
someone O
else O
. O

Unfortunately O
it O
’s O
a O
frustrating O
game O
of O
trial O
and O
error O
and O
being O
pretty O
miserable O
with O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
rashes O
in O
the O
process O
. O


That O
’s O
funny O
because O
my O
dr O
just O
called O
me O
today O
and O
said O
she O
was O
concerned O
about O
my O
liver O
as O
well O
. O

She O
said O
I O
did O
n’t O
need O
a O
transplant O
, O
but O
she O
wants O
to O
do O
more O
blood O
tests O
in O
1 O
month O
to O
see O
if O
there O
’s O
a O
change O
. O



 O
I O
’ve O
been O
on O
HUMIRA B-DRUG
for O
2 O
months O
( O
3 O
doses O
in O
. O

) O


 O
I O
took O
a O
30 O
day O
supply O
of O
generic O
celebrex B-DRUG
prescribed O
by O
her O
prior O
to O
starting O
Humira B-DRUG
because O
my O
inflammation B-ADR
levels O
via O
blood O
test O
were O
at O
40 O
during O
a O
“ O
flare B-ADR
up I-ADR
” O
this O
year O
( O
the O
normal O
is O
0.8 O
) O

I O
work O
in O
the O
medical O
field O
and O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
absolutely O
ridiculous O
they O
would O
force O
you O
to O
discharge O
for O
that O
reason O
. O

  

 O
Being O
on O
a O
biologic O
is O
the O
best O
bet O
you O
stay O
in O
remission O
, O
avoid O
hospitalizations O
, O
and O
avoid O
surgeries O
which O
obviously O
is O
in O
the O
army O
’s O
interest O
as O
much O
as O
it O
’s O
in O
your O
personal O
interest O
. O

  O
It O
’s O
way O
more O
likely O
you O
have O
to O
stop B-ADR
working I-ADR
because O
of O
untreated O
Crohns O
than O
because O
of O
contracting O
a O
rare O
infection B-ADR
or O
cancer B-ADR
related O
to O
biologics O
. O



 O
I O
’ve O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
several O
years O
now O
and O
I O
credit O
it O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
keep O
a O
very O
demanding O
, O
high O
stress O
, O
on O
- O
my O
- O
feet O
medical O
job O
I O
enjoy O
. O

I O
do O
feel O
more O
prone O
to O
having O
bad O
colds O
, O
but O
overall O
have O
had O
to O
miss O
minimal O
work O
days O
. O



 O
Also O
, O
no O
job O
is O
worth O
your O
health O
. O

  O
If O
your O
GI O
doc O
feels O
you O
are O
not O
in O
remission O
without O
biologics O
, O
then O
staying O
the O
current O
course O
will O
only O
lead O
to O
more O
inflammation B-ADR
and O
eventually O
bad O
things O
. O


Is O
he O
in O
the O
humira B-DRUG
complete O
program O
? O

I O
also O
take O
humira B-DRUG
and O
they O
have O
a O
sharps O
container O
/ O
send O
back O
program O
for O
free O

I O
’ve O
had O
stomach B-ADR
issues I-ADR
ever O
since O
starting O
arthritis B-ADR
medicine O
2 O
years O
ago O
. O

It O
was O
the O
worst O
for O
me O
on O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
( O
first O
one O
i O
took O
) O
. O

Then O
on O
humira B-DRUG
I O
continued O
to O
have O
stomach B-ADR
issues I-ADR
but O
not O
as O
bad O
as O
while O
I O
was O
on O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
. O

Same O
with O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
. O

For O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
I O
am O
about O
to O
switch O
to O
Stelara B-DRUG
. O

Fingers O
crossed O
it O
helps O
me O
with O
my O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
overall O
disease O
management O
. O



 O
I O
was O
only O
diagnosed O
in O
summer O
of O
2022 O
so O
i O
’m O
pretty O
new O
to O
this O
as O
well O
. O

However O
, O
you O
will O
quickly O
learn O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
what O
disease O
management O
consists O
of O
is O
trying O
new O
medicines O
until O
you O
find O
one O
that O
works O
to O
a O
level O
that O
you O
can O
live O
with O
while O
keeping O
side O
effects O
to O
a O
minimum O
. O



 O
Goodluck O
! O

Try O
to O
stay O
positive O
and O
remember O
that O
you O
are O
n’t O
alone O
in O
this O
journey O
. O

There O
are O
others O
of O
us O
who O
know O
first O
hand O
what O
you O
are O
going O
through O
🫶🏻. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
same O
boat O
as O
you O
. O

There O
’s O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
on O
the O
sub O
will O
give O
you O
shit O
if O
you O
say O
anything O
bad O
towards O
medication O
. O

I O
was O
in O
denial O
when O
I O
first O
got O
diagnosed O
because O
I O
never O
had O
an O
issue O
and O
I O
got O
diagnosed O
at O
28 O
. O

After O
being O
put O
in O
the O
hospital O
I O
knew O
it O
was O
serious O
. O

I O
was O
put O
on O
humira B-DRUG
even O
tho O
I O
was O
very O
nervous B-ADR
about O
all O
the O
side O
effects O
. O

I O
failed O
it O
in O
4 O
months O
and O
developed O
antibodies O
. O

I O
was O
then O
put O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
and O
6MP O
. O

I O
told O
my O
doctor O
I O
want O
three O
months O
to O
try O
diet O
and O
lifestyle O
before O
going O
on O
this O
medication O
. O

I O
tried O
and O
I O
did O
ok O
but O
I O
still O
had O
inflammation B-ADR
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
for O
about O
two O
years O
now O
and O
no O
longer O
on O
6mp O
. O

I O
still O
have O
inflammation B-ADR
  O
and O
I O
’ve O
never O
been O
in O
full O
l O
remission O
. O

  O
But O
for O
the O
most O
part O
I O
’m O
good O
. O

I O
wild O
say O
o O
have O
mild O
crohns O
thank O
god O
. O

Even O
before O
being O
diagnosed O
the O
worst O
thing O
I O
ever O
had O
with O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

Now O
I O
’m O
looking O
into O
the O
carnivore O
diet O
. O

I O
’m O
seeing O
crazy O
results O
from O
people O
that O
have O
IBD B-ADR
. O

I O
’m O
gon O
na O
try O
it O
for O
60 O
days O
. O

If O
my O
bloodwork O
does O
better O
I O
know O
it O
’s O
the O
diet O
and O
not O
the O
medication O
I O
’m O
praying O
I O
could O
finally O
get O
off O
the O
medication O
. O

I O
refuse O
to O
be O
on O
medication O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
. O

Whoever O
thinks O
diet O
does O
n’t O
play O
a O
roll O
in O
this O
  O
disease O
is O
absolutely O
crazy O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

I O
wish O
you O
the O
best O
of O
luck O

I O
have O
rheumatoid B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
, O
which O
is O
an O
autoimmune O
disease O
. O

I O
was O
on O
a O
daily O
regiment O
of O
4 O
prescribed O
meds O
and O
tramadol B-DRUG
twice O
a O
day O
. O

Until O
I O
started O
mushroom O
therapy O
. O

I O
currently O
take O
Lion O
's O
mane O
, O
turkey O
tail O
, O
reishi O
, O
chaga O
, O
cordyceps O
, O
and O
4 O
days O
on O
3 O
days O
off O
psilocybin B-DRUG
mushroom O
micro O
dose O
. O

After O
9 O
months O
my O
swelling B-ADR
is O
all O
but O
gone O
, O
I O
'm O
off O
all O
pain B-ADR
pills O
and O
am O
only O
taking O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
humira B-DRUG
to O
calm O
the O
immune O
system O
. O

One O
day O
I O
may O
be O
off O
of O
those O
. O

All O
I O
know O
is O
this O
, O
before O
I O
started O
mushroom O
therapy O
I O
was O
in O
constant O
pain B-ADR
and O
swollen B-ADR
. O

Now O
I O
'm O
not O
. O



 O
P.s O
. O

I O
get O
my O
mushroom O
powders O
from O
Host O
Defense O
, O
and O
my O
lions O
mane O
capsules O
on O
Amazon O
, O
but O
they O
are O
still O
host O
defense O
brand O
new O
but O
a O
few O
dollars O
cheaper O
. O


If O
you O
had O
remicade B-DRUG
at O
the O
first O
place O
, O
it O
was O
because O
the O
disease O
was O
not O
controlled O
by O
Prednisone B-DRUG
alone O
. O



 O
Thus O
, O
Prednisone B-DRUG
can O
not O
replace O
remicade B-DRUG
, O
it O
can O
only O
be O
a O
temporary O
solution O
to O
control O
the O
flare B-ADR
prior O
to O
another O
drug O
being O
used O
on O
the O
long O
run O


 O
Other O
options O
could O
be O
: O

- O
another O
anti O
TNF O
molecule O
for O
which O
you O
would O
not O
react O
( O
adalimumab B-DRUG
or O
biosimilars O
, O
or O
other O
anti O
TNF O

 O
Depending O
on O
what O
has O
marketing O
authorization O
/ O
reimbursement O
in O
your O
country O

I O
’ve O
taken O
Taltz B-DRUG
( O
worked O
well O
for O
me O
, O
but O
then O
my O
insurance O
changed O
and O
I O
had O
to O
go O
off O
it O
for O
a O
few O
months O
while O
I O
redid O
the O
preauthorization O
during O
COVID O
lockdown O
, O
and O
after O
that O
it O
did O
n’t O
work O
anymore O
) O
, O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
( O
did O
n’t O
work O
for O
me O
at O
all O
) O
, O
and O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
( O
worked O
well O
for O
about O
a O
year O
) O
, O
and O
now O
I O
’m O
about O
to O
go O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

In O
my O
experience O
are O
no O
side O
effects O
except O
that O
you O
ca O
n’t O
get O
the O
flu O
shot O
and O
you O
have O
to O
be O
more O
careful O
not O
to O
get O
exposed O
to O
illnesses B-ADR
, O
so O
I O
am O
still O
wearing O
N95 O
masks O
in O
public O
and O
made O
sure O
to O
get O
all O
my O
COVID O
boosters O
. O


This O
is O
me O
as O
well O
. O

I O
used O
to O
have O
crippling O
flare B-ADR
- I-ADR
ups I-ADR
, O
especially O
in O
the O
winter O
. O

But O
the O
last O
couple O
years O
, O
it O
's O
just O
been O
a O
constant O
annoying O
nagging O
pain B-ADR
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
related O
to O
dietary O
changes O
or O
not O
. O

But O
I O
Just O
started O
biologics O
( O
Humira B-DRUG
) O
after O
being O
diagnosed O
after O
11 O
years O
about O
2 O
months O
ago O
. O

Not O
much O
help O
yet O
, O
but O
over O
the O
last O
two O
weeks O
, O
I O
actually O
had O
my O
first O
real O
flare B-ADR
in O
years O
. O


I O
get O
them O
allllllll O
the O
time O
. O

Fingers O
, O
elbows O
, O
and O
the O
new O
one O
is O
bottom O
feet O
( O
the O
best O
place O
! O

) O
. O

My O
rheumatologist O
has O
linked O
it O
to O
my O
crohn O
's O
. O

In O
short O
it O
is O
leeching O
of O
toxins O
into O
the O
system O
from O
digestive O
track O
. O

They O
attack O
joints O
usually O
starts O
at O
outer O
ones O
fingers O
and O
toes O
. O

I O
find O
they O
are O
usually O
short O
lived O
. O

I O
find O
that O
certain O
drugs O
will O
minimize O
them O
( O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Remicade B-DRUG
) O
while O
my O
new O
one O
( O
Entivio B-DRUG
) O
is O
nt O
as O
good O
at O
it O
. O

This O
point O
in O
my O
disease O
i O
need O
my O
rheumatologist O
more O
because O
the O
Entivio B-DRUG
is O
helping O
just O
the O
bowel O
, O
and O
he O
can O
help O
the O
other O
issues O
like O
sore B-ADR
joints I-ADR
and O
these O
bumps B-ADR
. O



 O
Document O
what O
you O
can O
and O
do O
nt O
be O
afraid O
to O
seek O
other O
doctors O
help O
. O

Sometimes O
it O
takes O
a O
team O
. O


Yes O
! O

Lots O
. O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
ib O
2013 O
. O

Started O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
that O
made O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
difference O
. O

Then O
humira B-DRUG
was O
added O
and O
life O
was O
good O
. O

I O
could O
exercise O
and O
lose B-ADR
weight I-ADR
and O
felt O
awesome O
. O

I O
stayed O
on O
that O
till O
2019 O
when O
we O
learned O
that O
I O
also O
have O
MS B-ADR
so O
now O
I O
ca O
n't O
take O
the O
biologics O
. O

I O
tried O
Otezla B-DRUG
and O
had O
an O
adverse O
reaction B-ADR
. O

Then O
I O
tried O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
in O
November O
2019 O
and O
I O
love O
this O
med O
and O
I O
've O
happily O
been O
on O
it O
since O
then O
. O


Just O
curious O
, O
where O
do O
you O
inject O
yourself O
with O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
pen O
? O

When O
I O
first O
started O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
I O
was O
injecting O
myself O
on O
my O
thigh O
and O
that O
was O
really O
painful B-ADR
for O
me O
. O

It O
would O
leave O
bruises B-ADR
and O
red B-ADR
marks I-ADR
. O

I O
would O
dread O
the O
day O
I O
had O
to O
inject O
myself O
. O

I O
stopped O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
a O
year O
and O
now O
I O
’m O
back O
on O
it O
again O
, O
but O
this O
time O
I O
’m O
injecting O
the O
pen O
in O
my O
stomach O
area O
where O
I O
experience O
0 O
pain B-ADR
. O

Makes O
it O
a O
whole O
lot O
better O
! O

  O
Have O
you O
tried O
a O
different O
area O
and O
seeing O
if O
it O
’s O
less O
painful B-ADR
? O


yeah O
unfortunately O
for O
him O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
’s O
worked O
( O
including O
diet O
changes O
, O
extensive O
medicine O
including O
humira B-DRUG
, O
hibiclens B-DRUG
… O
) O
is O
deroofings O
, O
and O
even O
then O
his O
neck O
he O
’s O
had O
to O
get O
deroofed O
about O
ten O
times O
now O
cuz O
it O
keeps O
coming O
back O
🫠 O

Why O
did O
you O
decide O
to O
stop O
with O
the O
humira B-DRUG
? O


> O
I O
have O
been O
told O
by O
several O
pharmacies O
that O
If O
I O
stop O
humira B-DRUG
I O
may O
never O
be O
able O
to O
go O
back O
on O
it O
. O



 O
That O
really O
strange O
. O

I O
was O
never O
told O
that O
. O

In O
fact O
my O
doctor O
let O
's O
me O
skip O
a O
week O
once O
when O
I O
was O
on O
vacation O
and O
just O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
it O
. O

And O
I O
know O
other O
people O
who O
's O
doctors O
had O
them O
skip O
a O
dose O
when O
they O
had O
an O
infection B-ADR
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
it O
's O
a O
possibility O
, O
but O
I O
would O
n't O
get O
overly O
worried O
about O
it O
until O
you O
talk O
to O
the O
doctor O
. O


I O
hope O
you O
get O
the O
dx O
you O
need O
. O

A O
good O
rheumatologist O
is O
everything O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
mine O
kinda O
saved O
my O
life O
. O

Some O
docs O
are O
so O
useless O
and O
do O
n't O
listen O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
worked O
wonders O
for O
me O
until O
I O
built O
antibodies O
against O
it O
. O

I O
really O
think O
it O
's O
an O
awesome O
biologic O
. O


Yeah O
mine O
keeps O
mentioning O
low O
dose O
accutane B-DRUG
for O
life O
, O
but O
I O
think O
oral O
dapsone B-DRUG
would O
be O
better O
. O

Accutane B-DRUG
really O
fucked B-ADR
up I-ADR
my I-ADR
stomach I-ADR
.. O
I O
realllllyyy O
want O
to O
bring O
up O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
the O
specialist O
I O
’m O
seeing O
in O
February O
but O
they O
barely O
even O
acknowledged O
my O
scalp O
condition O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O


Remicade B-DRUG
worked O
well O
for O
me O
for O
10 O
years O
but O
i O
gradually O
got O
worse O
and O
worse O
the O
further O
I O
got O
from O
my O
last O
infusion O
, O
even O
at O
4 O
weeks O
frequency O
. O

Tested O
for O
antibodies O
multiple O
times O
and O
never O
had O
. O



 O
I O
switched O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
about O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
never O
been O
better O
. O

I O
was O
at O
higher O
than O
the O
average O
frequency O
of O
once O
every O
two O
weeks O
but O
I O
'm O
doing O
so O
well O
that O
I O
'm O
moving O
towards O
just O
once O
every O
two O
weeks O
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
time O
to O
switch O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
for O
sure O
if O
this O
is O
100 O
% O
Crohn O
's O
, O
especially O
after O
seeing O
ppl O
talk O
about O
AS O
( O
going O
to O
have O
to O
do O
some O
googling O
now O
) O
, O
but O
mine O
tends O
to O
be O
a O
low O
burning O
, O
constant O
radiating O
pain B-ADR
mostly O
in O
my O
knees O
with O
sporadic O
spikes O
of O
pain B-ADR
. O

They O
do O
n't O
usually O
swell B-ADR
though O
. O

If O
those O
spikes O
of O
pain B-ADR
were O
any O
stronger O
, O
it O
feels O
like O
my O
knee O
will O
give O
out O
completely O
, O
not O
from O
the O
pain B-ADR
( O
although O
it O
can O
be O
that O
bad O
) O
but O
it O
feels O
more O
like O
a O
mechanical O
failure O
? O



 O
I O
am O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
which O
oddly O
enough O
, O
I O
hear O
can O
treat O
joint O
pain B-ADR
but O
in O
some O
cases O
can O
also O
cause O
it O
? O

It O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
help O
in O
my O
case O
. O



 O
I O
also O
notice O
more O
general O
joint O
pain B-ADR
all O
over O
especially O
during O
rainy O
days O
. O

Funny O
how O
that O
happens O
. O

Atmospheric O
pressure O
or O
something O
. O


I O
’m O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
have O
been O
for O
about O
9 O
months O
since O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
. O

I O
started O
seeing O
symptoms O
return O
and O
my O
GI O
is O
thinking O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
n’t O
working O
now O
. O

I O
might O
be O
switching O
to O
remicade B-DRUG
infusions O
next O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
know O
how O
common O
it O
is O
but O
I O
certainly O
relate O
. O


That O
's O
great O
! O

I O
'm O
on O
the O
same O
path O
right O
now O
( O
hopefully O
) O
! O

Switching O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
Stellara B-DRUG
next O
week O
! O


Idk O
if O
my O
anemia B-ADR
was O
due O
to O
my O
possible O
AS O
( O
not O
diagnosed O
yet O
* O
) O
but O
I O
was O
anemic B-ADR
or O
borderline O
since O
16 O
or O
so O
. O



 O
I O
tried O
food O
, O
supplements O
( O
pill O
and O
liquid O
[ O
blech O
] O
) O
, O
adding O
vitamin B-DRUG
c I-DRUG
for O
better O
absorption O
with O
the O
supplements O
. O

What O
finally O
took O
care O
of O
it O
was O
an O
iron O
infusion O
. O



 O
* O
Have O
all O
the O
symptoms O
, O
no O
imaging O
proof O
, O
did O
n't O
get O
diagnosis O
from O
rheumatologist O
at O
6mo O
checkup O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
trial O
and O
do O
n't O
see O
her O
again O
until O
she O
's O
back O
from O
maternity O
leave O
. O

She O
did O
renew O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
prescription O
since O
it O
's O
working O
and O
my O
inflammation B-ADR
markers O
are O
19 O
from O
40 O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
has O
been O
great O
. O

I O
also O
found O
I O
needed O
to O
clean O
up O
my O
diet O
and O
mind O
, O
and O
exercise O
to O
really O
feel O
good O
again O
. O


AS O
is O
manageable O
on O
biological O
agents O
like O
adalimumab B-DRUG
. O

These O
drugs O
work O
like O
miracle O
. O

These O
costs O
a O
lot O
but O
if O
u O
can O
afford O
or O
have O
insurance O
go O
for O
them O
it O
will O
change O
your O
life O
. O

  O
I O
am O
myself O
having O
health O
issues O
and O
have O
similar O
mindset O
as O
u O
but O
it O
gives O
you O
to O
be O
more O
free O
. O

Free O
to O
live O
as O
u O
want O
. O

For O
me O
each O
day O
is O
struggle O
and O
i O
know O
it O
does O
n't O
count O
in O
anyway O
whether O

Arthritis B-ADR
( O

. O

  O
Been O
through O
a O
number O
of O
AI O
treatments O
: O
  O
Embrel B-DRUG
, O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
now O
( O
the O
best O
for O
me O
) O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
. O


Yes O
. O

Last O
year O
I O
had O
skin B-ADR
issues I-ADR
… O
pustules B-ADR
on O
my O
legs O
and O
arms O
that O
were O
itchy B-ADR
and O
then O
resolved O
as O
well O
as O
a O
burning B-ADR
sensation I-ADR
occasionally O
all O
over O
but O
especially O
in O
my O
eyes O
and O
genitals O
. O

It O
was O
supremely O
uncomfortable O
. O

The O
dermatologist O
did O
a O
biopsy O
and O
ANA O
testing O
and O
concluded O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
am O
told O
now O
to O
avoid O
all O
tnf O
inhibitors O
. O

She O
said O
it O
was O
a O
lupus B-ADR
skin B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
to O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


I O
'm O
on O
month O
5 O
of O
Accutane B-DRUG
for O
acne B-ADR
and O
HS O
and O
its O
completely O
cleared O
my O
face O
of O
acne B-ADR
and O
it O
really O
has O
started O
to O
help O
my O
HS O
the O
last O
few O
months O
. O



 O
My O
back O
, O
inner O
thighs O
, O
back O
of O
my O
neck O
, O
and O
the O
top O
of O
head O
( O
yes O
I O
get O
them O
there O
too O
occassionally O
) O
has O
been O
pretty O
clear O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now O
surprisingly O
. O



 O
I O
still O
am O
however O
getting O
them O
on O
my O
ass O
and O
waist O
line O
still O
, O
but O
they O
're O
not O
as O
bad O
and O
they O
heal O
quicker O
. O

Plus O
I O
attribute O
alot O
of O
that O
to O
me O
sitting O
alot O
of O
the O
day O
as O
I O
'm O
a O
driver O
for O
FedEx O
. O



 O
Aside O
from O
that O
and O
a O
bad O
one O
I O
got O
on O
my O
ear O
lobe O
a O
month O
ago O
, O
my O
HS O
has O
been O
better O
the O
last O
few O
months O
. O

I O
also O
have O
a O
pilonidal B-ADR
cyst I-ADR
. O

It O
's O
mild O
relative O
to O
alot O
of O
people O
, O
and O
I O
think O
the O
Accutane B-DRUG
has O
made O
it O
even O
milder O
, O
but O
it O
still O
flares B-ADR
up O
every O
month O
or O
2 O
and O
just O
did O
recently O
. O

Thankfully O
it O
healed O
up O
fairly O
quickly O
, O
4 O
or O
5 O
days O
. O



 O
But O
yeah O
, O
Accutane B-DRUG
's O
gotten O
rid O
of O
my O
facial O
acne B-ADR
, O
and O
I O
do O
think O
it O
's O
helped O
my O
HS O
the O
last O
few O
months O
, O
but O
it O
has O
n't O
completely O
gotten O
rid O
of O
it O
. O

I O
got O
one O
more O
month O
on O
it O
and O
if O
my O
HS O
is O
still O
present O
, O
which O
I O
suspect O
it O
will O
be O
, O
I O
'm O
probably O
gunna O
get O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
a O
few O
months O
after O
. O


Doc O
agreed O
, O
if O
I O
was O
n’t O
sleeping O
and O
having O
the O
mood B-ADR
swings I-ADR
, O
that O
pred B-DRUG
was O
n’t O
an O
option O
. O

He O
did O
want O
to O
start O
a O
combo O
therapy O
but O
, O
as O
he O
expected O
I O
declined O
infusions O
. O

Schedule O
and O
life O
style O
just O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
that O
approach O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
do O
IVs O
well O
. O

Tentatively O
I O
’ve O
agreed O
to O
humira B-DRUG
. O

Docs O
stand O
point O
is O
, O
that O
’s O
generally O
the O
approach O
that O
his O
other O
healthcare O
prof O
patients O
take O
. O


When O
I O
started O
humira B-DRUG
for O
my O
crohns O
some O
years O
ago O
it O
also O
burned B-ADR
! O

! O

! O

I O
told O
my O
doctor O
and O
she O
told O
me O
humira B-DRUG
has O
acid O
in O
it O
and O
there O
’s O
a O
humira B-DRUG
without O
acid O
in O
it O
! O

! O

! O

I O
do O
n’t O
know O
why O
they O
do O
n’t O
prescribe O
that O
one O
first O
and O
try O
the O
painful O
one O
later O
but O
I O
have O
n’t O
noticed O
any O
differences O
in O
how O
they O
help O
just O
that O
it O
hurts O
significantly O
less O

Hope O
this O
helps O

Yeah O
, O
whoever O
just O
recently O
denied O
this O
is O
saying O
its O
not O
medically O
necessary O
and O
I O
need O
to O
be O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
or O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Its O
crazy O
, O
I O
WAS O
on O
those O
first O
, O
and O
I O
developed O
antibodies O
that O
started O
me O
on O
a O
very O
serious O
flair B-ADR
. O

I O
was O
hospitalized O
and O
ended O
up O
with O
2 O
different O
surgeries O
. O

  O
But O
no O
lets O
go O
back O
to O
those O
medicines O
. O


Thanks O
! O

I O
've O
been O
on O
Entyvio B-DRUG
for O
about O
1.5 O
years O
and O
just O
had O
a O
colonoscopy O
that O
showed O
cellular O
remission O
. O

So O
, O
it O
's O
working O
. O

Prior O
to O
that O
I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
close O
to O
15 O
years O
. O

I O
had O
absolutely O
no O
side O
effects O
and O
loved O
that O
I O
could O
administer O
it O
at O
home O
. O

It O
only O
failed O
me O
when O
I O
had O
a O
baby O
and O
the O
post O
partum O
hormones O
caused O
a O
vicious O
flare B-ADR
. O

I O
hope O
Humira B-DRUG
works O
for O
you O
for O
a O
long O
long O
time O
! O


Cos O
Humira B-DRUG
’s O
lawyers O
are O
good O
at O
finding O
loopholes O
to O
extend O
the O
patent O
and O
stop O
genetics O
from O
being O
marketed O
/ O
approved O
. O


I O
’d O
avoid O
the O
surgery O
if O
you O
can O
. O

I O
held O
off O
on O
the O
immunosuppressants O
because O
of O
the O
pandemic O
also O
and O
ended O
up O
with O
an O
Ahmed O
tube O
in O
both O
eyes O
, O
good O
chunk O
of O
vision B-ADR
missing I-ADR
in O
one O
, O
and O
still O
ended O
up O
on O
humira B-DRUG
. O



 O
The O
recovery O
depends O
on O
how O
you O
heal O
and O
the O
procedure O
. O

I O
think O
my O
doc O
cleared O
me O
for O
light O
cardio O
around O
2 O
weeks O
and O
weightlifting O
at O
around O
a O
month O
. O



 O
My O
pressures O
before O
we O
’re O
hitting O
40 O
in O
one O
eye O
at O
64 O
in O
the O
other O
even O
with O
3 O
- O
4 O
drops O
and O
diamox B-DRUG
. O

Now O
I O
’m O
on O
one O
drop O
and O
pressures O
are O
around O
12 O
. O

Problem O
is O
you O
’ll O
have O
some O
hardware O
in O
your O
eye O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life O
and O
have O
to O
take O
some O
precautions O
. O

Also O
the O
surgery O
usually O
has O
to O
be O
revised O
after O
awhile O
as O
it O
scars B-ADR
up O
. O



 O
With O
all O
that O
said O
, O
I O
’d O
listen O
to O
your O
doctor O
and O
follow O
the O
advice O
whether O
it O
’s O
surgery O
, O
immunosuppressants O
, O
or O
both O
. O


I O
have O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
eight O
years O
now O
. O

My O
PSA O
is O
treatment O
resistant O
because O
it O
was O
triggered O
by O
lithium O
, O
so O
I O
still O
have O
flares B-ADR
. O


Yes O
, O
constantly O
, O
also O
having O
changed O
diet O
and O
exercise O
routines O
too O
  O
and O
I O
'm O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
years O
... O
So O
now O
I O
just O
own O
it O
and O
now O
just O
accept O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
toilet O
is O
now O
permanently O
destroyed O
during O
every O
visit O
and O
woe O
betide O
my O
beloved O
partner O
and O
daughter O
if O
they O
venture O
nearby O
to O
suffer O
the O
aftermath O
. O

:) O

Are O
these O
two O
different O
issues O
? O

If O
humira B-DRUG
goes O
up O
in O
price O
by O
x% O
, O
does O
that O
mean O
insurance O
wo O
n’t O
cover O
it O
any O
more O
? O

My O
letter O
just O
seemed O
to O
suggest O
it O
might O
be O
more O
out O
of O
pocket O
but O
since O
I O
do O
n’t O
really O
pay O
anything O
out O
of O
pocket O
, O
maybe O
I O
can O
just O
continue O
without O
issue O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
& O
Remicade B-DRUG
are O
very O
similar O
drugs O
as O
they O
work O
the O
same O
way O
( O
TNF O
blockers O
) O
and O
they O
’re O
  O
both O
great O
options O
! O

I O
do O
n’t O
have O
any O
experience O
with O
bio O
similars O
, O
but O
my O
understanding O
is O
that O
they O
are O
the O
exact O
same O
thing O
just O
cheaper O
for O
insurance O
to O
access O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
think O
one O
would O
necessarily O
“ O
choose O
” O
brand O
name O
vs. O
bio O
similar O
, O
most O
likely O
insurance O
would O
force O
them O
one O
way O
or O
another O
. O

I O
started O
off O
on O
azathioprine B-DRUG
, O
that O
is O
a O
pill O
once O
a O
day O
, O
but O
that O
was O
more O
because O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
when O
I O
was O
6 O
and O
I O
was O
n’t O
great O
with O
needles O
. O

nowadays O
they O
usually O
like O
to O
start O
you O
off O
on O
biologics O
immediately O
and O
add O
something O
like O
azathioprine/6MP B-DRUG
if O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
you O
from O
forming O
antibodies O
and O
to O
boost O
the O
efficiency O
of O
the O
drug O
. O

If O
I O
had O
the O
option O
between O
remicade B-DRUG
/ O
humira B-DRUG
, O
I O
would O
choose O
humira B-DRUG
simply O
because O
the O
delivery O
seems O
more O
convenient O
( O
injector O
pen O
at O
home O
vs O
long O
IV O
infusion O
) O
. O

there O
are O
A O
LOT O
of O
treatment O
options O
available O
for O
Crohn O
’s O
and O
it O
can O
be O
pretty O
overwhelming O
, O
so O
make O
sure O
to O
educate O
yourself O
on O
all O
of O
them O
! O


Neck B-ADR
pain I-ADR
is O
my O
main O
complaint O
too O
. O

I O
have O
done O
trigger O
point O
injections- O
which O
help O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O

I O
think O
the O
most O
help O
has O
been O
using O
a O
low O
orthopedic O
/ O
cervical O
pillow O
. O

I O
ca O
n’t O
sleep O
with O
my O
neck O
bent O
at O
all O
anymore O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
has O
helped O
my O
neck B-ADR
pain I-ADR
a O
lot O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
always O
the O
first O
place O
that O
flares B-ADR
. O


I O
had O
this O
same O
worry O
with O
imraldi B-DRUG
. O

I O
've O
been O
on O
it O
for O
a O
few O
years O
now O
and O
it O
's O
totally O
ok O
. O



 O
The O
injection O
pen O
is O
better O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
than O
the O
humira B-DRUG
pen O
. O



 O
Think O
of O
it O
as O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
different O
brand O
and O
packaging O
, O
you O
'll O
be O
ok O
. O


you O
explained O
that O
better O
than O
my O
own O
doctor O
. O

That O
would O
make O
more O
sense O
and O
I O
understand O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

Yeah O
my O
doctor O
thinks O
it O
’s O
best O
we O
move O
on O
to O
humira B-DRUG
so O
I O
hope O
everything O
goes O
well O
with O
that O
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
responding O
and O
sharing O
knowledge O
! O


Humira B-DRUG
will O
help O
, O
it O
cleared O
me O
up O
100 O
% O
. O

If O
you O
have O
any O
topicals O
try O
those O
. O

Ask O
your O
derm O
for O
shampoos O
or O
creams O
while O
you O
wait O
for O
the O
humira B-DRUG
. O


On O
the O
rare O
occasions O
I O
forget O
to O
take O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
by O
the O
next O
day O
I O
remember O
it O
because O
I O
'm O
in O
so O
much O
pain B-ADR
I O
can O
barely O
move O
. O



 O
No O
way O
on O
God O
's O
green O
earth O
will O
I O
live O
without O
meds O
. O


I O
am O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
take O
Mobic B-DRUG
when O
I O
need O
. O

So O
it O
’s O
scary O
when O
the O
swelling B-ADR
still O
does O
n’t O
go O
down O
. O


I O
know O
they O
still O
have O
patent O
moats O
, O
but O
I O
'd O
be O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
their O
longer O
term O
viability O
as O
Humira B-DRUG
starts O
losing O
certain O
patent O
protections O
. O

Possible O
yield O
trap O
. O


Oh O
, O
nice O
, O
yeah O
, O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
rep O
is O
great O
:) O
Glad O
you O
had O
an O
easy O
time O
with O
it O
, O
thank O
you O
for O
the O
kind O
words O
! O


i O
’m O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Sulfasalazine B-DRUG
but O
was O
told O
to O
pause O
for O
the O
week O
while O
i O
’m O
on O
Paxlovid B-DRUG
. O

If O
possible O
, O
talk O
to O
your O
PCP O
or O
specialist O
if O
you O
have O
one O
. O

Check O
your O
state O
/ O
city O
website O
for O
info O
too O
. O

If O
my O
rheumatologist O
did O
n’t O
give O
me O
access O

was O

I O
had O
a O
toxic B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
to O
humira B-DRUG
! O

Definitely O
call O
the O
OnCall O
to O
see O
if O
you O
should O
go O
in O
immediately O
. O

Do O
n't O
wait O
, O
it O
's O
so O
bad O
if O
it O
becomes O
toxic B-ADR
to O
your O
system O
. O


Who O
trained O
you O
to O
inject O
yourself O
? O



 O
This O
why O
I O
have O
said O
over O
and O
over O
and O
over O
methotrexate B-DRUG
should O
not O
be O
injected O
subQ. O
It O
was O
never O
ever O
ever O
ever O
allowed O
until O
the O
insurers O
and O
pharmacies O
had O
to O
order O
the O
needle O
separate O
from O
the O
syringe O
. O

My O
rheumatologist O
does O
not O
allow O
it O
and O
requires O
you O
to O
go O
to O
class O
one O
a O
year O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
continue O
to O
inject O
safely O
. O



 O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
should O
be O
injected O
IM O
into O
the O
top O
of O
the O
thigh O
( O
rotated O
weekly O
) O
with O
a O
27 O
gauge/2.5 O
or O
2.75 O
in O
needle O
with O
the O
preservative O
free O
methotrexate B-DRUG
in O
the O
single O
use O
vial O
. O

A O
drawback O
should O
be O
done O
just O
like O
you O
all O
should O
be O
doing O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Enbrel B-DRUG
etc O
because O
of O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
goes O
right O
into O
an O
artery O
or O
vessel O
it O
can O
make O
you O
very O
sick B-ADR
in O
minutes O
and O
depending O
how O
much O
went O
in O
could O
kill O
you O
within O
the O
hour O
. O



 O
To O
the O
OP O
- O
That O
your O
rheumatologist O
increased O
your O
dose O
from O
20 O
mg O
in O
tablet O
form O
to O
25 O
mg O
injected O
was O
incorrect O
. O

Your O
dose O
should O
have O
been O
at O
most O
20 O
mg O
or O
17.5 O
mg O
with O
a O
goal O
of O
lowering O
to O
15 O
- O
12.5 O
mg O
. O

I O
would O
ask O
why O
that O
was O
done O
and O
I O
would O
contact O
the O
FDA O
and O
report O
what O
happened O
with O
the O
manufacturer O
of O
the O
methotrexate B-DRUG
you O
injected O
in O
case O
there O
was O
a O
bad O
batch O
( O
which O
has O
happened O
in O
the O
past O
) O
. O


i O
am O
so O
tired O
. O

i O
have O
three O
autoimmune O
illnesses O
( O
crohns O
, O
hs O
, O
psoriasis B-ADR
) O
, O
and O
they O
never O
tell O
you O
how O
much O
of O
a O
toll O
it O
takes O
on O
your O
energy O
. O

i O
'm O
on O
humira B-DRUG
( O
immunosuppressant O
) O
and O
i O
ca O
nt O
take O
steroids B-DRUG
when O
i O
m O
sick B-ADR
because O
it O
triggers O
my O
hs O
and O
makes O
cysts B-ADR
appear O
all O
over O
my O
body O
. O

so O
basically O
i O
just O
have O
to O
suffer O
until O
the O
infection B-ADR
leaves O
my O
system O
which O
can O
take O
weeks O
to O
months O
for O
me O

I O
have O
hair B-ADR
loss I-ADR
due O
to O
Crohn O
’s O
in O
general O
I O
believe O
. O

I O
was O
only O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
4 O
months O
and O
could O
n’t O
tolerate O
it O
so O
they O
took O
me O
off O
it O
the O
end O
of O
March O
. O

I O
’ve O
taken O
Biotin O
for O
years O
and O
that O
’s O
failing O
me O
now O
too O
. O


They O
have O
more O
than O
enough O
stuff O
in O
the O
pipeline O
to O
make O
up O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

  O
They O
have O
been O
increasing O
their O
dividend O
by O
a O
hefty O
amount O
the O
last O
few O
years O
and O
have O
more O
than O
enough O
cash O
to O
cover O
it O
. O

  O
It O
's O
your O
money O
so O
buy O
whatever O
you O
want O
, O
but O
some O
of O
mine O
is O
in O
ABBV O
and O
I O
continue O
to O
add O
( O

have O
no O

not O
take O
Humira B-DRUG

other O
TNF O

, O
so O
I O
am O
guessing O
that O
is O
why O
they O
changed O

30 O
day O
run O
of O
boosting O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
beforehand O
. O



 O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
sounds O
scary O
but O
, O
I O
guess O
all O
biologics O
are O
scary O
to O
one O
degree O
or O
another O
. O


Yes O
I O
am O
also O
seronegative O
. O

MTX B-DRUG
was O
horrible O
for O
me O
, O
was O
on O
a O
sample O
pack O
of O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
changed O
my O
life O
, O
insurance O
wo O
n't O
cover O
it O
yet O
, O
so O
am O
now O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
! O

[ O

) O

Yes O
exactly O
that O
! O

Humira B-DRUG
sends O
them O
in O
the O
box O
with O
the O
medication O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
bought O
was O
small O
bandaids O
to O
put O
on O
after O
, O
I O
leave O
it O
on O
a O
few O
hours O
then O
take O
it O
off O

It O
’s O
hard O
to O
say O
what O
works O
for O
some O
may O
not O
work O
for O
others O
. O

I O
use O
happy O
distractions O
. O

My O
farm O
and O
animals O
are O
my O
medicine O
. O

( O
I O
’m O
also O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
prednisone B-DRUG
. O

) O
Does O
n’t O
heal O
the O
disease O
but O
keeps O
me O
from O
going O
down O
a O
rabbit O
hole O
of O
depression B-ADR
from O
chronic B-ADR
pain I-ADR

Find O
your O

My O
GI O
decided O
to O
stop O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
UC O
because O
of O
similar O
skin B-ADR
issues I-ADR
. O

I O
got O
an O
intense O
fungal B-ADR
rash I-ADR
that O
I O
've O
been O
treating O
for O
over O
a O
month O
. O

I O
get O
small O
bumps B-ADR
that O
start O
out O
like O
pimples B-ADR
but O
then O
turn O
into O
red O
scaly B-ADR
patches I-ADR
that O
peel O
. O

My O
heels O
are O
covered O
in O
little O
fluid O
- O
filled O
bumps B-ADR
that O
then O
become O
dry O
dead B-ADR
skin I-ADR
. O

A O
dermatologist O
examined O
a O
photo O
I O
sent O
to O
my O
primary O
doctor O
and O
said O
my O
issues O
were O
likely O
due O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
passed O
that O
information O
onto O
my O
GI O
. O


Looks O
like O
it O
wo O
n’t O
be O
approved O
in O
the O
US O
until O
next O
year O
, O
but O
has O
been O
available O
in O
Europe O
for O
several O
years O

a O
toss O
up O

 O
You O
either O
wake O
the O

dragon O

it O
tears O
you O
apart O

you O
’re O
fine O

 O
I O
went O
off O
everything O
for O
about O
5 O
months O
a O
couple O
years O
ago O
because O
of O
a O
reaction B-ADR
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

It O
was O
great O
! O

I O
was O
fine O
! O

The O
whole O
time O
. O

But O
everyday O
I O
woke O
up O
wondering O
when O
that O
would O
end O
. O

Would O
I O
make O
it O
to O
the O
next O
medication O
relatively O
okay O
? O

It O
was O
scary O
but O
freeing O
. O


Sorry O
for O
the O
super O
late O
reply O
, O
Reddit O
did O
n’t O
notify O
me O
and O
I O
do O
n’t O
get O
on O
here O
a O
whole O
lot O
. O



 O
Remicade B-DRUG
has O
been O
amazing O
for O
me O
. O

I O
tried O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
humira B-DRUG
and O
they O
do O
n’t O
even O
come O
close O
to O
the O
relief O
I O
’ve O
gotten O
from O
remicade B-DRUG
. O

Once O
I O
started O
I O
did O
n’t O
have O
a O
flare O
up O
for O
8 O
months O
. O

Then O
I O
had O
a O
ton O
of O
stress O
which O
triggered O
a O
bad O
flare B-ADR
up O
so O
we O
added O
cellcept B-DRUG
. O

Since O
then O
my O
inflammation B-ADR
is O
now O
under O
control O
again O
with O
very O
minimal O
/ O
manageable O
side O
effects O
( O
and O
I O
’m O
someone O
who O
is O
super O
reactive O
to O
medicine O
) O
and O
I O
’m O
off O
the O
cellcept B-DRUG
. O

If O
you O
end O
up O
getting O
prescribed O
it O
, O
I O
hope O
it O
works O
as O
well O
for O
you O

it O

I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
Amgevita B-DRUG
biosimilar O
for O
Crohn O
's O
for O
over O
12years O
now O
, O
with O
very O
little O
problem O
even O
whilst O
weekly O
. O

I O
get O
the O
usual O
post O
- O
injection O
headache B-ADR
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
, O
also O
itchy B-ADR
hands O
which O
an O
antihistamine O
takes O
care O
of O
. O

Blood O
tests O
are O
good O
, O
Crohn O
's O
is O
quiet O
. O

Much O
more O
effective O
and O
less O
side O
effects O
than O
the O
other O
drugs O
I O
tried O
before O
it O
. O



 O
Are O
you O
having O
problems O
with O
it O
? O


Not O
sure O
about O
taking O
it O
out O
of O
the O
country O
, O
but O
adalimumab B-DRUG
has O
to O
stay O
refrigerated O
so O
you O
have O
to O
account O
for O
that O

I O
should O
also O
mention O
I O
have O
crohns O
and O
take O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
it O
, O
and O
ever O
since O
I O
’ve O
started O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
I O
’ve O
gotten O
strange O
skin O
rashes B-ADR
that O
weep O
in O
my O
armpits O
etc O
so O
it O
could O
be O
related O

UC O
is O
horrible O
. O

Ugh O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
how O
I O
would O
have O
managed O
this O
disease O
if O
I O
was O
your O
age O
. O

Not O
being O
able O
to O
do O
the O
same O
things O
as O
your O
friends O
must O
feel O
frustrating O
and O
isolating O
. O

I O
've O
also O
felt O
hopeless O
and O
discouraged O
, O
but O
learned O
I O
ca O
n't O
dwell O
on O
the O
negative O
because O
that O
head O
space O
makes O
my O
UC O
symptoms O
worse O
. O

  O
I O
hope O
you O
find O
something O
that O
helps O
you O
feel O
less O
miserable O
. O

Fortunately O
for O
all O
of O
us O
, O
science O
is O
learning O
more O
about O
this O
disease O
and O
I O
believe O
more O
effective O
treatments O
or O
even O
a O
cure O
are O
in O
near O
future O
. O

By O
near O
, O
I O
mean O
in O
a O
decade O
or O
so O
. O

It O
sounds O
so O
far O
off O
( O
or O
an O
eternity O
in O
teenage O
years O
) O
but O
it O
will O
happen O
. O

The O
biologic O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
only O
been O
on O
the O
market O
since O
2002 O
and O
only O
approved O
for O
colitis B-ADR
treatment O
since O
2012 O
. O

Research O
is O
ongoing O
and O
better O
/ O
other O
biologics O
and O
other O
medications O
have O
been O
developed O
since O
then O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
by O
the O
time O
you O
are O
21 O
, O
there O
will O
be O
something O
more O
effective O
than O
the O
treatment O
you O
are O
on O
now O
. O

Stay O
hopeful O
. O

Science O
and O
time O
are O
on O
your O
side O
. O


I O
was O
diagnosed O
in O
2015 O
after O
an O
obstruction B-ADR
and O
years O
of O
bowel B-ADR
issues I-ADR
. O

Started O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
did O
n’t O
tolerate O
it O
well O
. O

Went O
off O
it O
because O
a O
tumor B-ADR
was O
found O
on O
my O
kidney O
and O
I O
needed O
a O
partial B-ADR
kidney I-ADR
removal I-ADR
. O



 O
Did O
n’t O
go O
back O
go O
GI O
doc O
and O
just O
have O
suffered O
for O
6 O
years O
. O

In O
December O
, O
I O
went O
back O
and O
got O
a O
colonoscopy O
. O

I O
now O
have O
ulcerated B-ADR
tears I-ADR
all O
along O
the O
crohns O
area O
( O
by O
ileum O
) O
. O

Strictures B-ADR
are O
so O
bad O
that O
every O
time O
I O
eat O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
am O
obstruction B-ADR
. O



 O
Now O
we O
have O
to O
find O
a O
path O
forward O
. O

Another O
biologic O
. O

Surgery O
? O



 O
Worst O
mistake O
I O
made O
was O
not O
going O
back O
and O
dealing O
with O
this O
in O
2016 O
after O
my O
kidney O
cancer B-ADR
was O
removed O
. O

Now O
I O
’m O
in O
way O
worse O
shape O
. O


Hi O
! O

I O
do O
n’t O
think O
you O
have O
anything O
to O
worry O
about O
:) O
I O
wore O
regular O
/ O
comfortable O
clothes O
at O
my O
first O
appointment O
. O

The O
doctor O
and O
I O
were O
mostly O
just O
discussing O
my O
pains O
, O
concerns O
, O
and O
my O
test O
results O
which O
I O
uploaded O
into O
their O
portal O
prior O
to O
my O
visit O
( O
if O
I O
remember O
right O
, O
it O
was O
MRI O
and O
X O
- O
ray O
scans O
) O
. O

He O
also O
checked O
my O
feet O
and O
my O
hands O
( O
which O
were O
the O
main O
areas O
of O
pain B-ADR
at O
the O
time O
) O
- O
I O
did O
n’t O
take O
anything O
off O
except O
my O
shoes O
, O
he O
wanted O
to O
see O
my O
feet O
because O
I O
told O
him O
my O
toes O
were O
mildly O
deformed O
. O

We O
also O
discussed O
a O
treatment O
plan O
which O
for O
us O
was O
between O
Humira B-DRUG
or O
Cimzia B-DRUG
since O
we O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
pregnant O
. O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
he O
ordered O
a O
ton O
of O
blood O
work O
which O
I O
had O
done O
the O
same O
day O
. O

Medication O
approval O
took O
about O
a O
week O
or O
two O
. O

That O
’s O
basically O
all O
. O



 O
Also O
- O
I O
went O
in O
on O
my O
own O
. O

I O
was O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
pain B-ADR
when O
I O
came O
in O
for O
the O
first O
time O
… O
limped O
my O
way O
into O
the O
clinic O
lol O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
think O
you O
need O
to O
bring O
anyone O
in O
less O
you O
need O
someone O
to O
help O
you O
walk O
. O

Maybe O
think O
of O
what O
questions O
to O
ask O
before O
your O
appointment O
so O
you O
wo O
n’t O
forget O
anything O
  O
… O
processing O
all O
this O
RA O
info O
the O
first O
time O
can O
be O
a O
little O
overwhelming O
. O


I O
'm O
about O
to O
start O
on O
MTX B-DRUG
with O
a O
biologic O
( O
Enbrel B-DRUG
) O
. O

I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
since O
April O
without O
MTX B-DRUG
, O
but O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
losing B-ADR
effectiveness I-ADR
, O
so O
we O
're O
switching O
. O



 O
My O
Dr O
say O
MTX B-DRUG
helps O
prolong O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
biologic O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
excited O
about O
starting O
MTX B-DRUG
, O
but O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
push O
back O
on O
it O
anymore O
. O

I O
was O
pretty O
bummed O
that O
Humira B-DRUG
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
. O

That O
was O
going O
pretty O
good O
, O
all O
things O
considered O
. O



 O
Psa O
( O
mostly O
) O
started O
this O
year O
. O

Came O
out O
of O
nowhere O
, O
but O
came O
on O
really O
hard O
. O

The O
Humira B-DRUG
almost O
put O
it O
in O
complete O
remission O
, O
and O
I O
had O
no O
really O
noticeable O
side O
effects O
. O

Hoping O
the O
next O
phase O
is O
similar O
. O


I O
have O
it O
widespread O
on O
my O
legs O
, O
abdomen B-ADR
, O
and O
arms O
. O

It O
moves O
around O
like O
Rorschach O
’s O
mask O
, O
but O
it O
never O
gets O
better O
. O

It O
just O
burns O
out O
in O
places O
and O
moves O
somewhere O
else O
. O



 O
Tried O
Plaquenil B-DRUG
and O
had O
a O
horrible O
systemic B-ADR
allergic I-ADR
reaction I-ADR
( O
first O
week O
of O
the O
pandemic O
, O
that O
was O
fun O
) O
. O

I O
have O
triamcinolone B-DRUG
in O
a O
tub O
but O
it O
does O
n’t O
do O
anything O
for O
the O
appearance O
, O
just O
the O
itch B-ADR
. O

They O
said O
I O
could O
try O
Humira B-DRUG
next O
but O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
how O
much O
that O
would O
cost O
me O
, O
and O
it O
carries O
a O
lot O
of O
risks O
for O
what O
is O
just O
a O
cosmetic O
issue O
mainly O
. O



 O
Apple O
cider O
vinegar O
can O
not O
affect O
GA O
because O
it O
occurs O
below O
the O
skin O
’s O
surface O
and O
ACV O
is O
just O
vinegar O
. O

Do O
n’t O
waste O
time O
and O
effort O
on O
that O
. O


Yeah O
. O

I O
did O
the O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
injections O
, O
instead O
of O
oral O
, O
which O
I O
was O
really O
nervous O
about O
. O

At O
least O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
auto O
- O
injector O
. O

I O
am O
fearful O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
ofHumira O
  O
as O
well O
. O


It O
's O
no O
different O
than O
the O
asshole O
who O
decided O
to O
charge O
$ O
700 O
per O
injector O
for O
insulin O
, O
but O
that O
guy O
got O
pinched O
because O
he O
was O
a O
smaller O
player O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
is O
owned O
by O
AbbVie O
, O
which O
is O
a O
large O
conglomerate O
, O
so O
they O
can O
get O
away O
with O
that O
shit O
. O


I O
did O
. O

I O
'm O
now O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
fortnightly O
! O

I O
'm O
glad O
to O
hear O
that O
you O
're O
staying O
on O
medication O
! O


Azathioprine B-DRUG
2 O
weeks O
, O
Humira B-DRUG
4 O
months O
, O
and O
I O
just O
started O
Stelara B-DRUG
and O
have O
my O
first O
at O
home O
dose O
in O
two O
weeks O
. O


Uck O
. O

I O
hate O
it O
's O
the O
only O
way O
to O
treat O
flares B-ADR
. O

There O
is O
only O
one O
time O
were O
the O
Prednisone B-DRUG
did O
n't O
have O
the O
usual O
side O
affects O
and O
completely O
suck O
. O

I O
had O
a O
really O
bad O
allergic B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
to O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
shot O
. O

The O
Humira B-DRUG
had O
made O
me O
feel O
so O
awful O
that O
if O
there O
were O
any O
side O
effects O
from O
the O
Prednisone B-DRUG
, O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
notice O
. O

Especially O
amazing O
since O
I O
was O
on O
a O
higher O
dosage O
and O
linger O
course O
than O
normal O
. O


Had O
I O
lived O
in O
the O
EU O
i O
would O
get O
FREE O
healthcare O
. O


For O
PsA O
when O
you O
fail O
Humira B-DRUG
the O
next O
treatment O
is O
a O
fentanyl B-DRUG
patch O
. O


All O
those O
amazing O
biologics O
in O
the O
US O
do O
nt O
make O
it O
to O
the O
EU O
for O
years O
and O
years O
. O

   O
So O
yes O
F O
those O
insurance O
companies O
. O

  O
But O
thank O
God O
we O
live O
in O
the O
US O
. O


I O
took O
paxlovid O
with O
prednisone B-DRUG
under O
advise O
from O
my O
dr O
. O

I O
waited O
for O
my O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
Humira B-DRUG
though O
until O
I O
was O
better O

I O
started O
xeljanz B-DRUG
years O
ago O
when O
it O
was O
on O
trial O
and O
that O
was O
after O
failing O
remicade B-DRUG
and O
humira B-DRUG
twice O
( O
entivyo B-DRUG
and O
Stelara B-DRUG
was O
n't O
out O
then O
) O
and O
I O
've O
been O
in O
remission B-ADR
since O
then O
. O

There O
's O
always O
hope O
! O


Start O
Stelara B-DRUG
or O
Remicade- B-DRUG
both O
stronger O
and O
higher O
efficacy O
than O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

It O
’s O
much O
easier O
to O
control O
the O
disease O
earlier O
before O
it O
gets O
worse O
. O

I O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
on O
mesalamine B-DRUG
then O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
when O
I O
could O
have O
been O
on O
a O
stronger O
medication O
earlier O
before O
my O
symptoms O
got O
severe O
. O

Everyone O
responds O
differently O
, O
but O
this O
was O
my O
experience O
! O

Stelara B-DRUG
is O
also O
subcutaneous O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
after O
induction O
, O
but O
less O
frequent O

Seriously O
. O

I O
wondered O
why O
she O
does O
n’t O
ask O
for O
people O
to O
store O
things O
temporarily O
. O

I O
have O
had O
refrigerated O
medication O
in O
the O
past O
… O
Humira B-DRUG
which O
costs O
$ O
1k O
per O
shot O
without O
insurance O
and O
I O
took O
one O
shot O
per O
week O
. O

I O
forget O
how O
many O
doses O
I O
had O
. O

You O
can O
be O
damn O
sure O
I O
stored O
those O
at O
a O
friend O
’s O
house O
when O
my O
electricity O
went O
out O
. O



 O
Our O
maybe O
Bethy O
does O
n’t O
have O
friends O
anymore O
since O
her O
“ O
I O
would O
really O
prefer O
DoorDash O
cards O
post O
partum O
because O
those O
homemade O
meals O
were O
really O
really O
tough O
to O
deal O
with O
after O
Davy O
’s O
birth O
. O

” O

My O
rheum O
told O
me O
to O
skip O
1 O
of O
my O
bi O
- O
weekly O
( O
14 O
day O
rotation O
) O
Humira B-DRUG
shots O
when O
I O
needed O
to O
get O
2 O
wisdom O
teeth O
removed O
. O

I O
still O
have O
n’t O
had O
the O
procedure O
done O
because O
I O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
skip O
a O
shot O
. O


Thank O
you O
for O
sharing O
your O
experience O
. O

I O
really O
appreciate O
this O
. O

I O
’m O
hoping O
you O
’ve O
found O
something O
new O
that O
works O
for O
you O
to O
replace O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
! O


And O
if O
you O
mumble O
" O
Adalimumab B-DRUG
, O
" O
no O
one O
's O
even O
going O
to O
remember O
what O
you O

Diagnosed O
1.5 O
years O
ago O
. O



 O
First O
6 O
months O
were O
miserable O
. O

  O
I O
found O
strength O
in O
focusing O
on O
the O
small O
lovely O
things O
in O
life O
. O

  O
The O
smell O
of O
flowers O
, O
the O
colors O
of O
autumn O
, O
the O
taste O
of O
coffee O
, O
time O
with O
friends O
, O
etc O
. O



 O
Did O
AIP O
and O
it O
helped O
10 O
% O
, O
but O
my O
GI O
symptoms O
have O
never O
been O
severe O
. O

  O
Would O
probably O
help O
more O
for O
someone O
with O
more O
GI O
symptoms O
. O



 O
Did O
32 O
hour O
water O
only O
fasts O
and O
they O
worked O
100 O
% O
until O
I O
ate O
food O
( O
bummer O
) O
. O



 O
Then O
they O
got O
me O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
since O
then O
, O
I O
actually O
live O
a O
pretty O
normal O
life O
. O

  O
I O
live O
with O
a O
fear O
that O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
will O
lose B-ADR
effectiveness I-ADR
over O
time O
and O
that O
they O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
find O
one O
that O
works O
as O
well O
for O
me O
, O
but O
that O
's O
just O
more O
motivation O
to O
enjoy O
the O
life O
I O
have O
for O
now O
. O



 O
Medicine O
is O
easy O
, O
if O
I O
take O
it O
, O
I O
live O
a O
normal O
life O
. O

  O
If O
I O
do O
n't O
I O
will O
eventually O
have O
suicide B-ADR
- O
inducing O
pain B-ADR
. O

  O
It O
's O
not O
really O
a O
choice O
. O



 O
I O
have O
n't O
accepted O
that O
this O
is O
life O
- O
long O
. O

  O
PSA O
and O
related O
autoimmune B-ADR
diseases I-ADR
are O
the O
subject O
of O
tremendous O
amounts O
of O
research O
and O
I O
hold O
out O
hope O
for O
a O
cure O
in O
a O
decade O
. O


I O
'm O
going O
through O
the O
exact O
same O
thing O
with O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
immunosuppressants O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
or O
Cimzia B-DRUG
( O
injections O
) O
worked O
for O
you O
but O
my O
doctor O
told O
me O
those O
are O
safe O
for O
if O
you O
're O
having O
liver B-ADR
issues I-ADR
. O


I O
second O
finding O
a O
new O
Rheumatologist O
, O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
a O
second O
or O
third O
opinion O
! O


I O
used O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
only O
3 O
months O
. O

It O
did O
little O
for O
me O
, O
and O
I O
had O
awful O
injection O
reactions O
. O


I O
took O
Simponi B-DRUG
for O
about O
9 O
months O
ish O
. O

Better O
than O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
had O
to O
inject O
every O
2 O
weeks O
instead O
of O
every O
month O
. O

Switched O
to O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
about O
6 O
months O
ago O
. O

I O
still O
have O
stiffness B-ADR
, O
pain B-ADR
and O
bad O
days O
but O
I O
can O
do O
more O
. O


No O
, O
they O
put O
me O
on O
right O
away O
. O

Even O
though O
my O
MRIs O
showed O
very O
little O
disease B-ADR
progression I-ADR
. O

But O
I O
did O
have O
a O
chest O
X O
- O
ray O
that O
showed O
inflammation B-ADR
in O
my O
sternum O
and O
( O
probably O
more O
important O
) O
, O
I O
suffer O
from O
recurring O
uveitis B-ADR
that O
needed O
to O
be O
managed O
very O
quickly O
. O

So O
there O
are O
very O
limited O
pharmaceutical O
options O
for O
me O
. O

But O
that O
combo O
was O
enough O
to O
get O
cleared O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


Can O
you O
maybe O
make O
a O
bullet O
point O
list O
of O
things O
to O
mention O
? O

Pain B-ADR
level O
, O
places O
you O
usually O
get O
flares B-ADR
, O
triggers O
, O
things O
like O
that O
? O



 O
When O
I O
went O
, O
it O
was O
more O
to O
see O
if O
biologics O
( O
Humira B-DRUG
) O
would O
be O
helpful O
. O

They O
did O
ask O
to O
see O
the O
spots O
but O
where O
mine O
are O
, O
I O
could O
sort O
of O
pull O
my O
basketball O
shorts O
up O
a O
little O
, O
and O
I O
was O
also O
able O
to O
leave O
a O
sports O
bra O
on O
for O
under O
arm O
spots O
. O

They O
asked O
lots O
of O
questions O
about O
my O
history O
, O
diet O
, O
etc O
. O

but O
the O
part O
I O
was O
scared O
of O
, O
showing O
them O
the O
affected O
areas O
, O
lasted O
about O
a O
minute O
and O
they O
made O
it O
much O
less O
scary O
than O
I O
worried O
it O
would O
be O
! O


I O
’m O
in O
Canada O
and O
have O
appointments O
with O
my O
GI O
every O
3 O
- O
4 O
months O
. O

It O
’s O
a O
phone O
or O
video O
check O
in O
usually O
, O
but O
they O
’ve O
been O
pretty O
consistent O
since O
I O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
- O
because O
I O
do O
n’t O
pay O
for O
the O
appointments O
, O
I O
’ve O
never O
asked O
if O
they O
could O
be O
more O
spaced O
out O
. O

The O
prescription O
is O
for O
1 O
year O
though O
. O


Get O
with O
your O
doctor O
asap O
. O

There O
are O
some O
great O
biologics O
out O
there O
for O
treatment O
. O

Assuming O
it O
’s O
necessary O
. O

I O
am O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
’s O
been O
phenomenal O
… O
had O
to O
try O
a O
few O
different O
ones O
over O
the O
years O
. O



 O
The O
alopecia B-ADR
, O
if O
it O
shows O
, O
I O
do O
exactly O
nothing O
. O

I O
used O
to O
get O
steroids O
blasted O
into O
my O
bald B-ADR
spots I-ADR
( O
NOT O
recommended O
at O
all O
, O
hurts B-ADR
like O
hell O
) O
but O
it O
just O
got O
to O
expensive O
for O
mediocre O
results O
. O

If O
it O
bothers O
you O
though O
see O
a O
dermatologist O
about O
it O
, O
there O
are O
things O
you O
can O
do O
. O


I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
it O
's O
been O
lifechanging O
for O
me O
. O

I O
rarely O
have O
flares B-ADR
and O
if O
one O
spot O
does O
become O
active O
, O
it O
's O
not O
painful B-ADR
and O
lasts O
only O
a O
day O
or O
so O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
issues O
with O
infections B-ADR
and O
find O
the O
injections O
are O
easy O
and O
mostly O
pain B-ADR
free O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
thankful O
that O
between O
health O
insurance O
and O
the O
AbbVie O
's O
assistance O
program O
, O
I O
only O
have O
a O
$ O
5 O
copay O
. O


Brain O
fogs O
usually O
happens O
when O
I O
have O
a O
flare O
and O
aside O
from O
pain B-ADR
are O
definitely O
the O
most O
annoying O
thing O
for O
me O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
has O
been O
a O
game O
changer O
for O
me O
and O
one O
thing O
that O
really O
make O
a O
difference O
is O
sleep O
. O

I O
feel O
worse O
when O
I O
do O
n’t O
get O
enough O
sleep O
and O
I O
sleep B-ADR
like I-ADR
crap I-ADR
when O
I O
’m O
in O
pain B-ADR
so O
I O
always O
try O
my O
best O
to O
get O
enough O
sleep O
. O

Also O
, O
others O
mentioned O
it O
but O
physical O
exercise O
is O
good O
but O
if O
I O
over O
do O
it O
then O
I O
have O
a O
flare O
so O
you O
need O
to O
learn O
your O
limitations O
. O


Yes O
, O
you O
are O
fine O
doing O
it O
today O
and O
then O
going O
back O
to O
your O
regular O
Wednesday O
schedule O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
15 O
+ O
years O
and O
have O
been O
off O
by O
a O
day O
or O
two O
several O
times O
with O
no O
issues O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
your O
nurse O
is O
right O

not O

but O
immunogenicity B-ADR

the O

a O

problem O
with O
Humira B-DRUG

some O
other O
biologics O
such O
as O

They O
often O
stop B-ADR
working I-ADR
after O
a O
few O
years O
. O

Not O
sure O
about O
Amgevita B-DRUG

 O
The O
clinical O
trials O
show O
newer O
biologics O
like O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
and O
Taltz B-DRUG
to O
be O
much O
better O
in O
terms O
of O
immunogenicity B-ADR
. O

Even O
though O
they O
do O
provoke O
ADAs O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
impair O
the O

 O
I O
'm O
down O
to O
try O
something O
new O
but O
really O
want O
to O
hear O
how O
other O
people O
experienced O
it O
since O
it O
's O
not O
FDA O
approved O
for O
HS O
( O
yet O
) O
. O


From O
what O
I O
understand O
about O
the O
article O
, O
it O
seems O
the O
issue O
is O
that O
people O
could O
be O
lacking O
a O
mechanism O
to O
remove O
intracellular O
calcium O
, O
which O
causes O
the O
pain B-ADR
. O

I O
wonder O
how O
you O
would O
fix O
that O
, O
someone O
more O
science O
inclined O
could O
answer O
, O
but O
is O
it O
like O
humira B-DRUG
which O
blocks O
tnf O
? O



 O
Could O
you O
have O
a O
biologic O
drug O
to O
create O
more O
NcX3 O
? O



 O
" O
To O
determine O
whether O
enhanced O
NCX3 O
expression O
can O
reduce O
spinal O
sensitization B-ADR
" O


 O
I O
'm O
not O
too O
sure O
how O
such O
drugs O
are O
made O
. O


I O
have O
been O
on O
the O
biological O
Stellara B-DRUG
for O
several O
months O
now O
and O
it O
has O
worked O
wonders O
. O

  O
Speak O
to O
your O
GI O
about O
it O
if O
they O
calling O
for O
biologics O
. O

  O
Humira B-DRUG
I O
wasent O
a O
fan O
of O
. O


That O
was O
me O
before O
I O
started O
humira B-DRUG
. O

  O
Everyone O
hated O
my O
ability O
to O
pound O
4 O
beers O
, O
a O
burger O
, O
fries O
and O
not O
gain O
a O
pound O
. O

 

 O
But O
now O
I O
’m O
like O
oooohhh O
that O
burger O
might O
cause O
me O
to O
weigh O
more O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
solid O
AS O
diagnosis O
yet O
but O
had O
a O
trial O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
of O
6 O
since O
I O
have O
all O
the O
symptoms O
but O
not O
clear O
imaging O
to O
back O
up O
a O
diagnosis O
. O

I O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
this O
last O
June O
. O

It O
can O
take O
awhile O
to O
notice O
the O
effects O
but O
it O
does O
work O
. O

I O
started O
to O
incrementally O
feel O
better O
. O

The O
shot O
still O
seems O
to O
" O
wear O
off O
" O
within O
a O
week O
( O
I O
do O
every O
two O
weeks O
) O
but O
it O
can O
take O
6 O
months O
to O
get O
the O
full O
effects O
. O

My O
inflammation B-ADR
marker O
( O
Sed O
rate O
) O
is O
down O
to O
20 O
from O
39 O
though O
so O
it O
's O
definitely O
doing O
some O
good O
. O

My O
rheum O
renewed O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
prescription O
for O
another O
6 O
months O
which O
is O
when O
I O
see O
her O
next O
. O

I O
have O
fibromyalgia B-ADR
along O
with O
some O
other O
diagnoses O
so O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
struggle O
on O
the O
pain B-ADR
management O
side O
. O



 O
I O
asked O
my O
rheumatologist O
on O
what O
vaccines O
to O
do O
at O
the O
appointment O
she O
wrote O
the O
script O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

She O
had O
me O
do O
hepatitis B-ADR
and O
pneumonia B-ADR
. O

For O
Fall O
, O
I O
've O
done O
flu O
and O
covid O
booster O
( O
the O
newest O
one O
) O
in O
October O
and O
this O
month O
it O
's O
my O
shingles B-ADR
shot O
. O

I O
'm O
46 O
so O
it O
's O
only O
a O
bit O
early O
. O



 O
I O
wear O
a O
mask O
, O
use O
hand O
sanitizer O
or O
wash O
my O
hands O
, O
go O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
hand O
cream O
( O
my O
hands O
dry O
out O
easily O

and O
have O
anyone O
I O
visit O
with O
inside O
( O
building O
or O
car O
) O
wear O
a O
mask O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
also O
covid O
tests O
to O
make O
sure O
everyone O
is O
covid O
negative O
where O
we O
'll O
be O
inside O
without O

staying O
overnight O

Mostly O
in O
the O
legs O

is O
why O
I O
feel O
so O
burdened O
by O
this O

) O
. O

The O
neuropathy B-ADR

has O
really O
been O
kicked O
up O

notch O

feel O
your O
pain B-ADR

quite O

are O
primary O
knees O

I O
used O

it O

that O

on O

losing O

generally O

I O
did O
n't O
realize O
how O
effective O
the O
methotrexate B-DRUG
was O
for O
me O
until O
I O
recently O
came O
off O
of O
it O
- O
within O
3 O
weeks O
, O
my O
body O
felt O
awful O
AND O
I O
had O
incredibly O
brain B-ADR
fog I-ADR
/ O
unclear O
thinking O
, O
which O
had O
n't O
been O
a O
symptom O
for O
me O
before O
. O

I O
'm O
hopeful O
that O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
works O
just O
as O
well O
! O



 O
A O
few O
suggestions O
that O
have O
been O
really O
helpful O
for O
me O

really O

the O
right O

so O
critical O
to O
me O
feeling O
well O
, O

pushing O
myself O

can O
land O
me O

do O

would O
look O
into O
getting O
an O

can O
assess O

8 O

It O
's O
a O
great O
biologic O
and O
has O
cleared O
my O
PSA O
entirely O

Just O
got O
ta O
be O
careful O
with O
things O
you O
would O
n't O
normally O
think O
of O
as O
far O
as O
illness B-ADR
goes O
, O
like O
food B-ADR

. O

I O
ate O
raw O

early O
on O
in O
my O
humira B-DRUG
career O
like O
an O
idiot O
and O
got O
hospitalized O
for O
a O
day O
with O
a O
gastro B-ADR

lol O
. O

Avoid O
raw O

the O
like O

you O
'll O
be O
totally O
fine O
. O


$ O
20k O
of O
medicine O
co O
- O
pays O
? O

That O
seems O
a O
bit O
high O
. O

But O
then O
, O
you O
could O
be O
on O
specialty O
brand O
name O
medicines O
. O

Just O
a O
thought O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
already O
, O
you O
should O
be O
checking O
the O
manufacturer O
sites O
for O
any O
co O
- O
pay O
cards O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
is O
a O
good O
example O
of O
a O
medication O
that O
's O
stupidly O
expensive O
but O
can O
be O
manageable O
with O
manufacturer O
assistance O
. O


FWIW O
, O
Humira B-DRUG
suppressed O
my O
uveitis B-ADR
flares O
( O
and O
other O
inflammation B-ADR
) O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
, O
around O
15 O
years O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
bad O
side O
effects O
from O
it O
. O



 O
My O
rheumatologist O
said O
there O
's O
no O
evidence O
of O
worse O
COVID O
outcomes O
for O
people O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
similar O
blockers O
, O
but O
I O
should O
continue O
taking O
precautions O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
feel O
like O
it O
's O
awful O
compared O
to O
what O
I O
would O
do O
if O
I O
were O
n't O
on O
TNF O
blockers O
. O



 O
One O
downside O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
if O
you O
are O
thinking O
of O
becoming O
pregnant O
, O
you O
may O
have O
to O
stop O
taking O
it O
in O
the O
third O
trimester O
. O



 O
Oh O
and O
the O
medication O
is O
expensive O
unless O
you O
have O
health O
insurance O
or O
qualify O
for O
assistance O
. O


Hi O
! O

I O
was O
also O
diagnosed O
at O
12 O
- O
I O
’m O
30 O
now O
. O

Be O
prepared O
for O
some O
mood B-ADR
swings I-ADR
and O
a O
larger O
appetite O
with O
prednisone B-DRUG
. O

And O
also O
some O
acne B-ADR
and O
skin B-ADR
issues I-ADR
as O
his O
body O
adjusts O
to O
the O
dosages O
. O

He O
’ll O
gain O
the O
weight O
back O
that O
he O
lost O
in O
no O
time O
. O

Prednisone B-DRUG
will O
give O
him O
energy O
like O
no O
other O
- O
but O
make O
sure O
he O
’s O
balancing O
it O
out O
with O
downtime O
. O

I O
speak O
from O
personal O
, O
and O
recent O
experience O
. O



 O
The O
CCFA O
was O
an O
incredible O
resource O
for O
me O
and O
I O
learned O
a O
lot O
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
reading O
some O
of O
your O
replies O
and O
if O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
the O
route O
his O
GI O
chooses O
- O
make O
sure O
that O
you O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
Abbvie O
ambassador O
program O
. O

This O
person O
will O
help O
find O
copay O
assistance O
, O
resources O
, O
and O
answer O
questions O
you O
may O
have O
. O



 O
Another O
thing O
is O
to O
be O
suuuuper O
comfortable O
talking O
about O
all O
things O
poop O
and O
all O
things O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
and O
make O
sure O
your O
family O
is O
too O
. O

My O
mom O
and O
I O
have O
zero O
boundaries O
( O
she O
was O
my O
lifeline O
) O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
talking O
about O
bowel O
habits O
in O
detail O
, O
diets O
, O
etc O
. O

because O
she O
knows O
that O
it O
makes O
me O
feel O
more O
“ O
normal O
” O
rather O
than O
feeling O
shy O
or O
embarrassed O
. O

It O
made O
it O
easier O
to O
speak O
to O
my O
doctors O
comfortably O
and O
to O
be O
more O
honest O
and O
up O
front O
in O
my O
appointments O
and O
my O
follow O
ups O
. O



 O
Also O
- O
do O
n’t O
feel O
like O
you O
’re O
“ O
stuck O
” O
with O
a O
GI O
. O

I O
spent O
ten O
years O
with O
a O
shitty O
one O
because O
I O
was O
afraid O
of O
“ O
starting O
over O
” O
. O

I O
finally O
broke O
away O
from O
him O
last O
year O
and O
it O
was O
the O
best O
thing O
I O
ever O
did O
for O
myself O
. O

My O
new O
GI O
is O
the O
most O
incredible O
person O
I O
’ve O
ever O
met O
and O
I O
regret O
not O
switching O
sooner O
. O



 O
Logging O
food O
and O
how O
it O
impacts O
life O
is O
a O
fantastic O
idea O
. O

“ O
Crohn O
’s O
diet O
” O
varies O
from O
person O
to O
person O
. O

I O
know O
fellow O
crohnies O
that O
ca B-ADR
n’t I-ADR
eat I-ADR
things O
like O
lettuce O
and O
cucumbers O
and O
I O
eat O
them O
constantly O
! O

Meanwhile O
those O
same O
people O
can O
eat O
whole O
grains O
and O
berries O
and O
such O
and O
both O
will O
send O
me O
into O
a O
tailspin O
. O



 O
I O
’m O
more O
than O
happy O
to O
be O
there O
for O
you O
to O
bounce O
questions O
off O
of O
! O


I O
'm O
so O
sorry O
. O

All O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
sucks O
and O
I O
can O
literally O
feel O
your O
pain B-ADR
. O



 O
We O
all O
react O
so O
differently O
to O
meds O
. O

Like O
Humira B-DRUG
which O
is O
being O
touted O
as O
the O
miracle O
drug O
for O
HS O
actually O
only O
works O
for O
about O
25 O
% O
of O
HS O
people O
. O

I O
know O
, O
spiro B-DRUG
can O
be O
the O
same O
in O
that O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
for O
everyone O
. O

I O
've O
not O
seen O
stats O
on O
spiro B-DRUG
as O
to O
what O
percentage O
of O
HS O
people O
it O
works O
for O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
on O
200 O
mg O
of O
spiro B-DRUG
and O
tolerate O
it O
very O
well O
. O

I O
've O
read O
the O
studies O
about O
spiro B-DRUG
helping O
people O
at O
lower O
doses O
but O
my O
doctor O
wanted O
to O
do O
200 O
mg O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
take O
her O
prescribed O
dose O
because O
if O
it O
was O
going O
to O
work O
then O
it O
definitely O
would O
at O
that O
dose O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
choosing O
to O
take O
the O
metformin B-DRUG
to O
see O
if O
helps O
even O
more O
by O
controlling O
my O
insulin O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
pre O
- O
diabetic B-ADR
but O
I O
am O
approaching O
menopause B-ADR
and O
that O
's O
when O
folks O
in O
my O
family O
start O
to O
edge O
towards O
diabetes B-ADR
. O

So O
it O
's O
worth O
a O
shot O
on O
many O
levels O
. O



 O
& O
# O
x200B O
; O


 O
I O
do O
have O
a O
curiosity O
question O
... O
When O
you O
say O
that O
you O
had O
hair B-ADR
loss I-ADR
on O
spiro O
, O
I O
assume O
you O
mean O
the O
hair O
on O
your O
head O
. O

Yes O
? O

I O
ask O
because O
I O
thought O
spiro B-DRUG
was O
known O
for O
having O
a O
positive O
effect O
on O
the O
head O
hair O
. O

As O
in O
helping O
it O
not O
thin O
out O
as O
it O
slows O
down O
the O
production O
of O
androgens O
. O



 O
& O
# O
x200B O
; O


 O
I O
really O
do O
hope O
you O
find O
what O
works O
for O
you O
to O
lower O
your O
HS O
flares B-ADR
. O


Obviously O
this O
is O
just O
anecdotal O
and O
everyone O
’s O
risk O
levels O
are O
different O
, O
but O
I O
’ve O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
ten O
years O
now O
and O
have O
needed O
no O
lifestyle O
changes O
at O
all O
. O

I O
have O
n’t O
gotten O
sick B-ADR
any O
more O
than O
I O
did O
before O
, O
and O
I O
’m O
pretty O
active O
outdoors O
and O
lax O
with O
germs O
. O

For O
me O
it O
was O
a O
no O
brainier O
because O
I O
was O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
pain B-ADR
before O
I O
started O
the O
drug O
, O
so O
I O
understand O
if O
you O
do O
n’t O
have O
that O
you O
might O
not O
be O
as O
enthusiastic O
. O

I O
’m O
sure O
there O
’s O
some O
data O
out O
there O
on O
how O
and O
to O
what O
degree O
humira B-DRUG
suppresses O
the O
immune O
system O
, O
I O
would O
ask O
your O
doctor O
for O
that O
info O
so O
you O
can O
make O
an O
informed O
decision O
. O


It O
worked O
. O

Started O
it O
a O
year O
before O
surgery O
. O

  O
It O
made O
life O
manageable O
but O
it O
did O
n’t O
stop O
the O
surgery O
. O

  O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
i O
humira B-DRUG
before O
my O
surgery O
. O

  O
When O
I O
stopped O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
work O
or O
do O
anything O
. O

  O
Went O
back O
on O
it O
after O
surgery O
. O

  O
Been O
in O
remission O
11 O
years O
now O

I O
’m O
so O
excited O
to O
try O
Humira B-DRUG
! O

Have O
you O
used O
it O
? O

How O
long O
for O
results O
, O
also O
she O
’s O
prescribing O
me O
some O
oil O
( O
forgot O
the O
name O
) O
for O
my O
scalp O
to O
sit O
over O
night O
in O
to O
help O
the O
psoriasis B-ADR
, O
but O
waiting O
for O
insurance O
to O
approve O
that O
also O

Whenever O
I O
've O
flared O
its O
been O
due O
to O
my O
maintenance O
drug O
failing O
me O
; O
last O
instance O
being O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Doc O
put O
me O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
at O
40 O
mg O
to O
get O
me O
under O
control O
, O
starting O
tapering O
while O
I O
was O
scheduled O
for O
Entyvio B-DRUG
. O

It O
took O
2 O
- O
3 O
Entyvio B-DRUG
treatments O
to O
get O
back O
to O
my O
" O
normal O
" O
and O
have O
been O
good O
ever O
since O
. O

During O
that O
time O
I O
stayed O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
at O
around O
20 O
mg O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
to O
maintain O
, O
and O
then O
started O
tapering O
again O
once O
I O
had O
an O
entyvio B-DRUG
treatment O
. O



 O
Prednisone B-DRUG
and O
it O
's O
variants O
are O
not O
meant O
to O
be O
the O
only O
medication O
for O
UC O
. O

They O
are O
generally O
a O
" O
quick O
fix O
" O
type O
medicine O
to O
help O
alleviate O
symptoms O
and O
inflammation B-ADR
while O
another O
, O
safer O
drug O
has O
time O
to O
take O
effect O
such O
as O
a O
biologic O
. O


Thanks O
for O
catching O
my O
error O
! O

I O
do O
know O
Remicade B-DRUG
is O
a O
biologic O
! O

It O
should O
have O
said O
" O
another O
biologic O
" O
- O
I O
thought O
I O
caught O
all O
my O
typos O

errors O
before O
submitting O

 O
I O
appreciate O
you O
sharing O
your O
experience O
. O

The O
fatigue B-ADR
does O
n't O
sound O
great O
but O
I O
could O
plan O
around O
it O
so O
that O
's O
not O
a O
huge O
hurdle O
. O

I O
'm O
already O
tired O
from O
the O
HS O
flares O
anyways O
! O

I O
'm O
in O
between O
flares B-ADR
right O
now O
so O
if O
I O
want O
to O
start O
the O
infusions O
, O
now O
it O
's O
the O
ideal O
time O
. O



 O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
my O
insurance O
would O
be O
an O
issue O
. O

I O
luckily O
have O
amazing O
coverage O
on O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
pens O

I O
’m O
so O
glad O
your O
quality O
of O
life O
has O
improved O
! O

I O
have O
a O
rheumatologist O
and O
am O
on O
Cimzia B-DRUG
as O
Humira B-DRUG
was O
not O
successful O
for O
me O
. O

My O
younger O

also O
has O
AS O

! O

I O
love O
Humira B-DRUG

This O
was O
my O
thought O
too O
. O

I O
take O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
’s O
scary O
that O
rates O
of O
AI O
diseases O
are O
increasing O
so O
quickly O
. O

The O
number O
of O
commercials O
for O
biologics O
is O
crazy O
. O


Otezla B-DRUG
is O
particularly O
known O
for O
causing O
anxiety B-ADR
and O
depression B-ADR
. O

For O
most O
people O
( O
but O
not O
all O
) O
, O
the O
gastrointestinal O
stuff O
passes O
after O
1 O
- O
2 O
weeks O
as O
the O
body O
acclimates O
to O
the O
drug O
. O



 O
All O
systemic O
drugs O
have O
a O
risk O
of O
side O
effects O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
side O
effects O
are O
highly O
individual O
, O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
predict O
whether O
you O
will O
experience O
any O
of O
them O
. O

You O
can O
look O
at O
the O
rates O
of O
side O
effects O
from O
published O
clinical O
trials O
, O
and O
this O
can O
be O
useful O
in O
giving O
you O
a O
picture O
of O
what O
to O
expect O
, O
but O
it O
just O
tells O
you O
the O
overall O
trend O

 O
Of O
the O

 O
Among O
the O
above O
drugs O
, O
the O
one O
that O
is O
almost O
without O
doubt O
the O
most O
effective O
( O
measured O
in O
ACR50 O
and O
ACR70 O
in O
clinical O
trials O
) O
is O
Taltz B-DRUG
, O
which O
is O
an O
IL-17A O
inhibitor O
. O

( O
There O
are O
earlier O
IL-17A O
inhibitors O
like O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
, O
but O
Taltz B-DRUG
is O
_ O
much O
_ O
more O
effective O
due O
to O
much O
higher O
affinity O
  O
for O
the O
IL-17A O
protein O
. O

) O
Taltz B-DRUG
' O
side O
effects O
are O
relatively O
mild O
, O
and O
depression B-ADR
is O
not O
among O
them O
. O

Unlike O
some O
biologics O
, O
Taltz B-DRUG
does O
not O
require O
regular O
blood O
testing O
. O

Taltz B-DRUG
is O
injected O
subcutaneously O
( O
autoinjector O
) O
every O
4 O
weeks O
. O



 O
The O
other O
medications O
on O
the O
list O
_ O
can O
_ O
be O
great O
. O

Again O
, O
everyone O
responds O
differently O
. O



 O
You O
really O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
your O
doctor O
, O
though O
. O

In O
most O
cases O
you O
ca O
n't O
pick O
your O
own O
medication O
, O
though O
you O
can O
certainly O
ask O
, O
and O
many O
doctors O
give O
you O
different O
options O
. O


Perhaps O
a O
second O
opinion O
would O
n't O
hurt O
? O

There O
are O
other O
biologics O
beside O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
I O
've O
never O
heard O
of O
a O
CT O
scan O
being O
a O
true O
indicator O
of O
how O
your O
intestines O
look O
. O

Not O
to O
question O
the O
doctor O
, O
but O
I O
've O
always O
done O
colonoscopies O
before O
any O
major O
procedures O
or O
drug O
changes O
were O
made O
. O

Something O
to O
think O
about O
before O
irreversible O
procedures O
or O
bags O
being O
placed O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
if O
things O
are O
truly O
that O
severe O
do O
not O
wait O
to O
long O
. O

Best O
of O
luck O
to O
you O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
is O
a O
actually O
free O
in O
norway O
, O
because O
we O
have O
a O
very O
good O
health O
system O
:) O

Are O
you O
taking O
methotrexate B-DRUG
as O
well O
? O

That O
combo O
works O
best O
so O
your O
body O
does O
n’t O
build O
antibodies O
to O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


On O
Remicade B-DRUG
( O
basically O
IV O
form O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
) O
and O
went O
through O
the O
loading O
doses O
which O
takes O
a O
few O
months O
. O

After O
going O
through O
the O
loading O
doses O
I O
was O
ready O
to O
give O
up O
, O
but O
we O
got O
a O
drug O
level O
test O
and O
found O
I O
was O
just O
clearing O
the O
drug O
very O
rapidly O
. O

We O
upped O
the O
dose O
and O
decreased O
the O
frequency O
between O
infusions O
and O
now O
feel O
amazing O
. O



 O
I O
'd O
encourage O
you O
to O
talk O
to O
your O
GI O
about O
getting O
a O
drug O
level O
test O
. O

If O
it O
's O
low O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
antibodies O
you O
can O
up O
the O
dose O
( O
take O
more O
pens O
at O
once O
) O
and/or O
decrease O
the O
frequency O
between O
when O
you O
take O
them O
. O

If O
you O
have O
antibodies O
or O
you O
have O
high O
drug O
levels O
( O
I O
'd O
personally O
look O
for O
10 O
- O
20 O
) O
then O
it O
might O
be O
time O
to O
think O
about O
moving O
on O
. O


Oh O
man O
, O
that O
thought O
has O
only O
recently O
crossed O
my O
mind O
as O
a O
possibility O
. O

It O
started O
in O
my O
SI O
and O
then O
after O
getting O
Covid O
last O
January O
, O
it O
was O
like O
10/10 O
hip O
/ O
groin B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

Where O
I O
ca O
n’t O
roll O
over O
in O
bed O
and O
lift O
my O
legs O
and O
I O
’m O
waddling O
like O
I O
’m O
9 O
months O
pregnant O
all O
the O
time O
. O

I O
’m O
32 O
so O
it O
just O
seems O
inconceivable O
that O
I O
would O
need O
a O
hip O
replacement O
you O
know O
? O

And O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
was O
working O
until O
I O
got O
pregnant O
again O
. O

Not O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
Cimzia B-DRUG
injections O
but O
just O
hoping O
for O
relief O
… O

I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
HS O
, O
which O
I O
had O
a O
weird O
skin B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
to- O
broke O
out O
in O
weird O
rashes B-ADR
all O
over O
my O
body O
and O
my O
hair B-ADR
was I-ADR
falling I-ADR
out- I-ADR
so O
I O
probably O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
go O
back O
on O
any O
biologics O
, O
at O
least O
not O
for O
the O
time O
being O
:/ O

i O
want O
to O
add O
, O
after O
being O
terrified O
of O
meds O
for O
two O
years O
and O
bed O
- O
ridden O
to O
now O
having O
naturally O
/ O
permanently O
fused O
joints O
in O
my O
20s O
from O
not O
being O
medicated O
… O
i O
am O
now O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
probably O
will O
be O
team O
biologic O
forever O
. O

the O
food O
route O
did O
n’t O
work O
for O
me O
alone O
and O
there O
are O
many O
other O
factors O
like O
stress O
, O
sleep O
, O
and O
hormones O
that O
food O
works O
too O
slowly O
to O
help O
me O
( O
but O
again O
, O
i O
am O
weak O
- O
minded O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
diet O
) O
. O

my O
goal O
is O
to O
work O
toward O
the O
AIP O
but O
i O
am O
slowly O
working O
my O
way O
toward O
that O
and O
living O
mostly O
pain O
- O
free O
on O
a O
biologic O
. O


So O
I O
had O
an O
extreme O
reaction B-ADR
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
about O
6 O
months O
and O
over O
that O
time O
I O
slowly O
developed O
a O
completely O
scaled O
psoriasis B-ADR
helmet O
over O
my O
entire O
head O
. O

All O
my O
hair B-ADR
fell I-ADR
out I-ADR
. O

My O
team O
referred O
me O
to O
dermatology O
and O
they O
took O
a O
lot O
of O
bio O
samples O
. O

Apparently O
I O
had O
the O
worst O
case O
of O
this O
specific O
side O
effect O
that O
either O
team O
had O
ever O
seen O
and O
the O
results O
of O
my O
tests O
were O
published O
in O
a O
journal O
with O
my O
approval O
. O




 O
So O
yes O
it O
's O
definitely O
a O
side O
effect O
. O

I O
've O
also O
been O
told O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
treatments O
for O
Crohns O
can O
also O
he O
used O
to O
treat O
psoriasis B-ADR
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
psoriasis B-ADR
when O
you O
take O
them O
, O
they O
can O
end O
up O
giving O
it O
to O
you O
from O
some O
kind O
of O
negative O
feedback O
loop O
( O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
doctor O
but O
that O
's O
vaguely O
what O
I O
picked O
up O
) O
. O




 O
Key O
thing O
to O
look O
out O
for O
will O
be O
your O
hair O
coming O
out O
in O
the O
shower O
. O

That O
's O
the O
first O
thing O
that O
really O
alarmed O
me O
and O
I O
should O
have O
immediately O
sought O
consultation O
but O
I O
left O
it O
a O
bit O
longer O
and O
it O
was O
a O
disaster O
. O

Luckily O
though O
, O
it O
all O
grew O
back O
! O


Not O
a O
scientist O
, O
just O
a O
clinician O
, O
and O
I O
have O
shallow O
experience O
with O
either O
med O
, O
though O
I O
've O
had O
patients O
who O
took O
each O
of O
them O
. O

  O
I O
have O
n't O
read O
or O
heard O
anything O
specific O
about O
the O
combo O
, O
but O
I O
see O
no O
indication O
that O
Paxlovid B-DRUG
would O
be O
inhibited O
or O
potentiated O
by O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
or O
vice O
versa O
, O
based O
on O
the O
reported O
MoA O
and O
pharmacokinetics O
of O
either O
drug O

 O
More O
broadly O
, O
what O
I O
've O
read O
suggests O
that O
people O
with O

enstilar B-DRUG
on O
top O
of O
humira B-DRUG
and O
hope O
it O
improves O
. O


I O
had O
to O
stop O
Remicade B-DRUG
treatment O
because O
I O
am O
allergic B-ADR
to O
it O
( O
Humira B-DRUG
too O
) O
. O

Instead O
of O
switching O
straight O
to O
a O
new O
medicine O
( O
long O
story O
) O
, O
I O
stopped O
medicating O
my O
Crohn O
’s O
for O
about O
8 O
months O
. O

That O
’s O
also O
how O
long O
it O
took O
me O
to O
flare B-ADR
. O

I O
’ve O
now O
been O
in O
my O
flare B-ADR
for O
two O
years O
… O
I O
definitely O
do O
n’t O
recommend O
it O
lol O
not O
that O
you O
would O
… O
but O
even O
out O
of O
necessity O
, O
the O
result O
of O
stopping O
meds O
has O
sucked O
. O


No O
difference O
in O
my O
UC O
with O
four O
months O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
no O
side O
effects O
. O

However O
, O
if O
I O
'm O
late O
on O
my O
dose O
, O
my O
hips O
, O
back O
, O
and O
knees O
hurt B-ADR
like O
HELL O
. O

I O
'm O
only O
30 O
and O
have O
never O
had O
pain B-ADR
like O
that O
prior O
to O
this O
drug O
. O


Sounds O
a O
lot O
like O
what O
I O
went O
through O
before O
I O
got O
on O
the O
right O
meds O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
my O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
messes O
with O
my O
ligaments O
and O
other O
things O
, O
which O
feel O
like O
sore B-ADR
muscles I-ADR
. O

Yoga O
is O
an O
incredible O
asset O
and O
will O
help O
keep O
you O
flexible O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
that O
if O
they O
see O
progression O
in O
the O
fusion O
, O
and O
if O
you O
feel O
you O
are O
a O
good O
candidate O
, O
to O
do O
the O
injections O
. O

I O
bounced O
around O
with O
humira B-DRUG
and O
all O
those O
before O
settling O
on O
remicade B-DRUG
every O
5 O
weeks O
. O

The O
meds O
have O
saved O
my O
life O
, O
though O
they O
do O
come O
with O
the O
possibility O
of O
side O
effects O
. O



 O
I O
thought O
AS O
was O
a O
death B-ADR
sentence O
, O
but O
really O
the O
worst O
of O
it O
is O
( O
for O
me O
) O
that O
it O
has O
forced O
me O
to O
live O
a O
healthy O
, O
active O
lifestyle O
. O

Find O
some O
light O
exercise O
, O
figure O
out O
what O
foods O
cause O
flares B-ADR
; O
because O
they O
do O
no O
matter O
how O
hard O
your O
doctor O
denies O
it O
. O

Do O
n’t O
even O
bother O
going O
there O
with O
95 O
% O
of O
doctors O
and O
just O
do O
your O
own O
research O
. O

Yoga O
, O
walking O
, O
body O
weight O
exercises O
, O
swimming O
, O
climbing O
, O
etc O
. O

You O
HAVE O
to O
stay O
ahead O
of O
it O
, O
or O
it O
will O
consume O
you O

Getting O

has O
helped O
me O
with O
the O
loneliness O
of O
having O
to O
sit O
at O
home O
for O
days O
at O
a O
time O
when O
I O
have O
a O
really O
bad O

Reach O

<3 O

I O
'm O
injecting O
myself O
with O
humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
have O
ample O
experience O
of O
poking O
other O
people O
as O
I O
'm O
working O
as O
a O
physician O
. O



 O
You O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
ram O
the O
needle O
in O
. O

It O
's O
what O
we O
usually O
do O
on O
others O
, O
but O
even O
after O
4y O
of O
injections O
I O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
to O
myself O
. O

I O
usually O
put O
the O
needle O
on O
my O
skin O
, O
and O
if O
it O
already O
hurts B-ADR
a O
lot O
, O
usually O
I O
've O
poked O
a O
little O
skin O
nerve O
, O
and O
so O
I O
change O
spots O
( O
even O
a O
mm O
is O
sufficient O
) O
. O

Then O
I O
just O
push O
in O
slowly O
. O

Also O
, O
applying O
pressure O
on O
the O
skin O
fold O
helps O
, O
because O
your O
spinal O
pain B-ADR
signalling O
will O
be O
inhibited O
if O
there O
is O
also O
pressure O
signals O
coming O
in O
. O



 O
Then O
: O
I O
personally O
did O
n't O
like O
my O
belly O
first O
, O
but O
I O
've O
figured O
out O
that O
it O
's O
less O
painful B-ADR
there O
than O
on O
my O
legs O
. O

You O
can O
actually O
just O
do O
it O
wherever O
you O
can O
grab O
a O
bit O
of O
skin O
with O
fat O
comfortably O
. O

Basically O
the O
area O
where O
you O
want O
to O
inject O
should O
be O
as O
relaxed O
as O
possible O
, O
and O
I O
just O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
well O
for O
my O
legs O
( O
even O
though O
I O
also O
have O
fat O
there O
) O
. O

So O
I O
usually O
sit O
down O
, O
grab O
the O
skin O
fold O
on O
my O
belly O
with O
the O
full O
second O
hand O
( O
after O
desinfecting O
) O
, O
then O
I O
poke O
around O
a O
little O
and O
then O
inject O
where O
it O
does O
n't O
really O
hurt O
. O

Sometimes O
I O
'll O
also O
hit O
a O
painful B-ADR
spot O
further O
in O
, O
just O
moving O
the O
needle O
a O
tiny O
bit O
usually O
helps O
a O
lot O
. O



 O
Then O
: O
inject O
slowly O
( O
I O
usually O
take O
about O
10seconds O
or O
so O
) O
, O
because O
the O
pressure O
of O
the O
injecting O
liquid O
can O
be O
a O
bit O
uncomfortable B-ADR
too O
if O
you O
are O
doing O
it O
too O
quickly O
. O

Then O
I O
wait O
a O
few O
seconds O
, O
and O
pull O
out O
. O

Also O
the O
whole O
needle O
protecting O
stuff O
is O
n't O
really O
important O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
infect O
yourself O
with O
anything O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
already O
have O
, O
so O
I O
usually O
do O
n't O
use O
that O
and O
throw O
the O
whole O
thing O
in O
a O
needle O
bin O
. O


You O
wo O
n’t O
get O
there O
if O
you O
’re O
not O
honest O
with O
your O
doctor O
, O
you O
’ll O
continue O
to O
suffer O
. O



 O
If O
it O
is O
skin B-ADR
cancer I-ADR
, O
skin B-ADR
cancer I-ADR
is O
very O
treatable O
. O

I O
work O
in O
a O
dermatology O
practice O
, O
we O
see O
patients O
with O
skin B-ADR
cancer I-ADR
all O
day O
, O
every O
day O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
the O
treatment O
is O
n’t O
even O
that O
intense O
— O
it O
can O
be O
frozen O
off O
or O
injected O
and O
it O
will O
die O
. O

I O
had O
a O
questionable O
lesion O
removed O
many O
years O
ago O
and O
it O
was O
literally O
a O
painless O
process O
, O
thanks O
to O
local O
anesthesia O
. O

The O
worst O
part O
was O
the O
stitches O
itched O
. O



 O
We O
also O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
patients O
with O
psoriasis B-ADR
. O

As O
someone O
who O
had O
severe O
psoriasis B-ADR
( O
my O
legs O
were O
covered O
, O
my O
scalp O
was O
covered O
, O
and O
I O
had O
large O
patches O
on O
my O
torso O
, O
my O
groin O
, O
and O
it O
was O
in O
my O
ears O
) O
, O
biologics O
are O
a O
life O
changer O
. O

I O
’m O
not O
kidding O
. O

These O
days O
if O
you O
’re O
in O
the O
US O
methotrexate B-DRUG
is O
not O
the O
go O
- O
to O
treatment O
because O
the O
side O
effects O
suck O
. O

Depending O
on O
your O
doctor O
it O
will O
most O
likely O
be O
a O
brand O
name O
drug O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
oral O
medication O
options O
as O
well O
. O




 O
As O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
where O
you O
are O
, O
seriously O
, O
imagine O
getting O
into O
a O
shower O
and O
not O
feeling O
like O
your O
whole O
body O
is O
on O
fire O
. O

Imagine O
not O
bleeding B-ADR
on O
all O
of O
your O
clothes O
. O

Imagine O
not O
having O
to O
sweep O
or O
vacuum O
12 O
times O
a O
day O
. O

It O
’s O
absolutely O
possible O
, O
but O
not O
if O
you O
let O
your O
anxiety B-ADR
rule O
your O
life O
. O


That O
’s O
just O
one O
person O
. O

That O
does O
not O
mean O
you O
would O
react O
that O
way O
. O

Biologics O
have O
made O
me O
stronger O
and O
allow O
me O
to O
spend O
less O
time O
feeling O
sick B-ADR
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
people O
are O
just O
fine O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

  
 O
Have O
you O
had O
x O
- O
rays O
or O
an O
MRI O
to O
establish O
a O
baseline O
understanding O
of O
your O
spine O
, O
so O
you O
can O
monitor O
how O
well O
the O
natural O
remedy O
is O
keeping O
fusion O
at O
bay O
? O

Have O
you O
measured O
your O
flexibility O
for O
the O
same O
reasons O
? O

If O
you O
’re O
going O
to O
avoid O
conventional O
treatment O
at O
least O
be O
smart O
about O
it O
. O


I O
need O
to O
completely O
reset O
- O
think O
my O
Keto O
. O

  O
Going O
to O
the O
gym O
is O
possible O
again- O
Humira- B-DRUG
but O
man O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
burn O
this O
weight O
off O
from O
both O
ends O
. O


I O
have O
something O
similar O
, O
my O
ankles O
just O
give O
out O
on O
me O
randomly O
. O

I O
've O
noticed O
it O
's O
happened O
far O
less O
since O
I O
've O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
Lyrica B-DRUG
, O
my O
pt O
says O
it O
could O
be O
my O
nerves O
firing O
wrongly O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
mystery O
for O
sure O
. O


I O
had O
this O
happen O
to O
me O
today O
actually O
. O

My O
humira B-DRUG
was O
supposed O
to O
come O
Friday O
but O
was O
delayed O
until O
today O
. O

I O
called O
my O
pharmacy O
with O
concerns O
Friday O
, O
they O
called O
UPS O
and O
was O
assured O
they O
had O
a O
refrigerated O
place O
to O
keep O
the O
medication O
. O

Well O
it O
came O
Monday O
. O

The O
ice O
packs O
were O
warm O
. O



 O
I O
called O
the O
pharmacy O
again O
and O
they O
are O
shipping O
me O
a O
new O
box O
of O
medication O
with O
a O
return O
label O
and O
box O
for O
the O
ones O
that O
went O
bad O
. O

I O
was O
told O
one O
of O
the O
shots O
would O
be O
ok O
to O
use O
since O
my O
next O
dose O
is O
in O
a O
week O
. O

But O
the O
second O
one O
ca O
n't O
be O
used O
. O



 O
Call O
the O
pharmacy O
or O
your O
ambassador O
. O

It O
'll O
work O
out O
. O


I O
'm O
fixing O
to O
start O
this O
too O
, O
just O
waiting O
on O
the O
pre- O
authorization O
from O
the O
insurance O
. O

I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
it O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
for O
me O
. O

Good O
luck O
! O

I O
hope O
it O
helps O
. O

🙂 O

If O
it O
’s O
just O
a O
cold O
( O
no O
fever B-ADR
, O
etc O
) O
then O
I O
’ll O
still O
do O
it O
. O

If O
I O
have O
a O
fever B-ADR
or O
any O
other O
symptoms O
( O
body O
aches B-ADR
, O
vomiting B-ADR
, O
diarrhea B-ADR
, O
etc O
) O
then O
I O
will O
delay O
until O
my O
symptoms O
are O
gone O
. O

These O
were O
the O
instructions O
from O
my O
prescribing O
doc O
. O

I O
’ve O
never O
experienced O
any O
issues O
after O
delaying O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
by O
1 O
- O
2 O
weeks O
, O
thankfully O
, O
but O
your O
doctor O
will O
also O
want O
to O
balance O
the O
risks O
of O
injection O
vs O
relapse O
of O
your O
underlying O
disease O
. O


Female O
and O
yeah O
, O
probably O
half O
my O
hair O
has O
thinned O
out O
since O
I O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
've O
been O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
longer O
, O
so O
that O
dose O
was O
lowered O
and O
I O
think O
that O
's O
helped O
some O
new O
hair O
grow O
back O
. O

I O
've O
been O
on O
the O
cusp O
of O
cutting O
all O
of O
my O
near O
waist O
- O
length O
hair O
off O
for O
a O
couple O
months O
. O

Neither O
my O
GI O
or O
Rheum O
are O
particularly O
worried O
about O
it O
, O
which O
is O
annoying O
, O
but O
at O
least O
otherwise O
my O
symptoms O
are O
managed O
well O
. O

I O
also O
switched O
to O
folinic O
acid O
instead O
of O
folic B-DRUG
acid I-DRUG
... O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
absorb O
better O
so O
maybe O
that O
's O
also O
halted O
the O
thinning O

I O
was O
taking O
Arcoxia B-DRUG
in O
addition O
to O
taking O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
doses O
for O
my O
AS O
for O
a O
while O
. O

Its O
basically O
a O
stronger O
than O
average O
anti O
inflammatory O
and O
it O
can O
help O
with O
flare B-ADR
ups I-ADR
. O

It O
eventually O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
as O
well O
on O
me O
and O
now O
i O
m O
no O
longer O
on O
it O
after O
about O
2 O
or O
3 O
years O
. O

And O
now O
thisnwas O
maynebe O
5 O
years O
ago O
since O
i O
last O
had O
Arcoxia B-DRUG
. O

With O
it O
being O
medication O
though O
, O
it O
effects O
each O
person O
differently O
, O
so O
you O
may O
have O
the O
same O
experience O
i O
had O
, O
or O
you O
may O
find O
it O
working O
for O
longer O
. O


I O
failed O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Simponi B-DRUG
at O
2x O
frequency O
and O
dosage O
. O



 O
I O
’ve O
been O
on O
the O
Remicade B-DRUG
biosimilar O
Inflectra B-DRUG
for O
almost O
4 O
years O
, O
has O
had O
me O
in O
remission O
for O
nearly O
a O
year O
, O
no O
adverse O
reactions O
in O
all O
that O
time O
! O


I O
mean O
this O
to O
be O
food O
for O
thought O
, O
as O
kindly O
and O
gently O
as O
possible O
: O
is O
an O
injection O
every O
couple O
of O
weeks O
worse O
than O
the O
pain B-ADR
you O
’re O
in O
now O
? O



 O
Having O
taken O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
I O
can O
run O
you O
through O
some O
of O
how O
it O
works O
: O
Abbvie O
makes O
it O
feel O
like O
you O
’re O
in O
a O
special O
club O
, O
to O
the O
point O
that O
it O
’s O
kind O
of O
weird O
. O

You O
get O
assigned O
a O
nurse O
who O
calls O
you O
and O
walks O
you O
through O
everything O
. O

They O
send O
you O
a O
kit O
, O
including O
a O
fake O
injection O
pen O
to O
practice O
with O
. O

There O
’s O
an O
app O
that O
you O
can O
track O
your O
injections O
with O
. O



 O
The O
needle O
itself O
is O
teeny O
tiny O
. O

If O
you O
’re O
using O
the O
injection O
pen O
, O
you O
wo O
n’t O
even O
see O
it O
. O

There O
’s O
a O
newer O
formulation O
that O
does O
n’t O
sting O
( O
make O
sure O
that O
’s O
what O
your O
doc O
prescribes O
) O
. O

If O
you O
get O
the O
original O
formulation O
, O
it O
’s O
still O
not O
that O
bad O
. O

You O
do O
n’t O
really O
feel O
the O
needle O
, O
it O
’s O
mostly O
just O
liquid O
that O
’s O
cooler O
than O
body O
temperature O
. O



 O
I O
had O
regular O
blood O
tests O
, O
and O
I O
was O
a O
lot O
more O
immunosuppressed O
on O
steroids O
than O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Still O
, O
make O
sure O
you O
’re O
up O
to O
date O
on O
vaccinations O
, O
and O
take O
extra O
care O
of O
yourself O
. O



 O
It O
may O
not O
be O
the O
right O
med O
for O
you O
in O
the O
end O
, O
but O
if O
your O
doctor O
thinks O
it O
’s O
a O
good O
option O
, O
it O
may O
be O
worth O
a O
shot O
. O

Literally O
. O

😁 O

I O
went O
from O
MTX B-DRUG
and O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
in O
about O
2016 O
. O

It O
’s O
been O
amazing O
. O

Easily O
the O
best O
med O
I O
’ve O
been O
on O
. O

My O
only O
side O
effect O
is O
that O
I O
get O
sinus B-ADR
infections I-ADR
more O
frequently O
and O
I O
have O
a O
permanent O
mild O
post B-ADR
- I-ADR
nasal I-ADR
drip I-ADR
. O



 O
Even O
my O
eczema B-ADR
has O
cleared O
up O
. O


It O
's O
your O
call O
. O

You O
should O
feel O
comfortable O
saying O
this O
drug O
ai O
n't O
it O
and O
move O
on O
. O

I O
have O
been O
through O
at O
least O
10 O
rheumis O
in O
my O
25 O
years O
of O
diagnosis O
. O

It O
's O
a O
weak O
field O
and O
they O
're O
not O
all O
good O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
all O
listen O
. O

If O
your O
not O
comfortable O
communicating O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
hear O
you O
, O
move O
on O
. O

You O
will O
eventually O
find O
some O
good O
ones O
! O

Plaquenil B-DRUG
and O
humira B-DRUG
worked O
the O
longest O
for O
me O
. O

Blown O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
meds O
. O

I O
mean O
a O
lot O
. O

Currently O
on O
rituxan B-DRUG
about O
3 O
years O
and O
working O
well O

He O
could O
speak O
with O
the O
specialty O
pharmacist O
that O
fills O
his O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

This O
would O
be O
right O
up O
their O
alley O
. O


I O
’ve O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
almost O
a O
year O
now O
. O

Aside O
from O
getting O
Covid O
booster O
more O
frequently O
than O
the O
average O
Joe O
, O
I O
’m O
living O
life O
completely O
normal O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
mask O
in O
public O
( O
nothing O
against O
it O
, O
I O
just O
have O
n’t O
felt O
the O
need O
) O
, O
and O
have O
n’t O
needed O
to O
avoid O
anything O
else O

I O
am O
44 O
and O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
AS O
around O
18 O
. O

From O
18 O
to O
29 O
, O
I O
was O
on O
a O
cocktail O
of O
NSAIDs O
, O
painkillers O
, O
and O
muscle O
relaxants O
just O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
each O
day O
. O

I O
did O
not O
want O
people O
to O
know O
the O
pain B-ADR
I O
was O
in O
, O
so O
I O
pushed O
through O
and O
put O
on O
the O
best O
outward O
appearance O
I O
could O
, O
often O
causing O
so O
much O
more O
pain B-ADR
. O

It O
was O
exhausting B-ADR
, O
mentally O
, O
emotionally O
, O
and O
physically O
. O

I O
began O
seeing O
a O
new O
rheumatologist O
in O
2007 O
( O
I O
was O
seeing O
my O
GP O
primarily O
for O
maintenance O
at O
that O
point O
) O
, O
and O
he O
suggested O
that O
we O
try O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

It O
truly O
changed O
my O
life O
in O
a O
way O
I O
did O
not O
know O
was O
possible O
. O

It O
has O
allowed O
me O
to O
live O
the O
last O
15 O
years O
with O
little O
pain B-ADR
, O
and O
be O
active O
and O
productive O
because O
of O
that O
. O

I O
still O
have O
small O
flareups B-ADR
, O
which O
are O
often O
times O
tied O
to O
periods O
of O
high O
stress O
, O
but O
nothing O
like O
the O
debilitating O
flareups B-ADR
I O
used O
to O
have O
regularly O
prior O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Humira B-DRUG
has O
allowed O
me O
to O
live O
as O
" O
normal O
" O
a O
life O
as O
possible O
. O


Never O
had O
injections O
before O
, O
however O
I O
'm O
might O
be O
considering O
this O
option O
for O
my O
hips O
. O



 O
First O
advice O
is O
do O
n't O
over O
think O
and O
stress O
yourself O
, O
try O
to O
be O
positive O
😊 O


 O
These O
options O
helped O
many O
people O
( O
based O
on O
discussions O
with O
my O
radiologist O
and O
doc O
) O
. O



 O
If O
you O
ever O
feel O
nervous B-ADR
, O
ask O
for O
some O
sort O
of O
sedatives O
, O
relaxant O
. O

They O
should O
be O
able O
to O
provide O
with O
this O
on O
the O
day O
. O



 O
The O
good O
news O
is O
they O
'll O
have O
to O
numb B-ADR
the O
SI O
area O
before O
injecting O
the O
numbing B-ADR
injection O
, O
then O
20 O
mins O
later O
you O
'll O
get O
your O
steroid O
injection O
. O



 O
we O
can O
ask O
for O
the O
procedure O
to O
be O
done O
on O
separate O
days O
? O

Not O
sure O
how O
it O
works O
where O
ur O
based O
? O



 O
Lastly O
if O
u O
finding O
cimzia B-DRUG
is O
n't O
really O
helping O
, O
discuss O
with O
ur O

I O
’ve O
been O
drinking O
fresh O

  O
Thanks O

the O
time O
to O

years O
& O
I O

I O

effectiveness B-ADR
I I-ADR
’d I-ADR
wearing I-ADR
off I-ADR
like O
humira B-DRUG
did O
… O
inflecktra B-DRUG
worked O
but O
gave O
me O
skin B-ADR
abcesses I-ADR
. O

I O
’m O
just O
having O
no O
luck O
lol O

Also O
, O
the O
American O
college O
of O
rheumatology O
recommends O
Humira B-DRUG
as O
a O
first O
treatment O
- O
I O
'm O
surprised O
you O
have O
n't O
been O
on O
it O
yet O
. O

  O
Also O
also O
, O
Humira B-DRUG
biosimilars O
( O
waaaaay O
cheeper O
) O
will O
be O
available O
in O
January O
so O
your O
insurance O
should O
n't O
complain O
about O
trying O
that O
one O
next O
. O


Basically O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
a O
brand O
and O
recently O
other O
companies O
were O
allowed O
to O
make O
their O
own O
( O
cheaper O
) O
versions O
of O
it O
. O

Insurance O
and O
hospitals O
prefer O
you O
go O
on O
the O
ones O
that O
cost O
less O
- O
its O
the O
same O
medicine O
but O
different O
brands O
. O

Someone O
else O
in O
the O
thread O
has O
gone O
into O
detail O
on O
how O
it O
works O
. O



 O
And O

. O

Maybe O
that O
's O
what O
's O
adding O
to O
my O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

Would O
you O
mind O
sharing O
what O
supplements O
have O
helped O
you O
? O


That O
's O
awesome O
! O



 O
I O
know O
, O
the O
nearest O
to O
an O
overnight O
miracle O
would O
be O
a O
shot O
of O
steroids O
but O
I O
'm O
not O
willing O
to O
do O
it O
this O
time O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
worked O
well O
for O
me O
for O
a O
year O
and O
it O
took O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
to O
kick O
in O
( O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
loading O
dose O
) O
, O
so O
it O
's O
a O
waiting O
game O
now O
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
sharing O
your O
experience O
on O
it O
. O


I O
have O
ulcerative B-ADR
colitis I-ADR
and O
have O
2 O
kids O
. O

I O
was O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
with O
my O
first O
and O
Humira B-DRUG
with O
my O
second O
. O

I O
always O
see O
a O
high O
risk O
OB O
doctor O
once O
during O
pregnancy O
who O
never O
has O
any O
concerns O
and O
recommends O
a O
monthly O
ultrasound O
to O
make O
sure O
baby O
is O
growing O
okay O
. O

Low B-ADR
birth I-ADR
weight I-ADR
is O
a O
risk O
, O
but O
personally O
I O
have O
huge O
babies O
so O
I O
wonder O
if O
this O
is O
more O
dependent O
on O
disease O
activity O
during O
pregnancy O
. O

My O
joint O
pain B-ADR
is O
my O
most O
plaguing O
symptom O
and O
it O
always O
improves O
during O
pregnancy O
! O

The O
monthly O
ultrasounds O
is O
the O
only O
positive O
thing O
to O
come O
out O
of O
IBD B-ADR
:) O
happy O
to O
answer O
any O
questions O

So O
inspiring O
. O

  O
13 O
years O
ago O
I O
was O
covered O
with O
psoriasis B-ADR
everywhere O
from O
the O
neck O
down O
. O

  O
I O
was O
put O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
was O
clear O
in O
3 O
months O
and O
my O
doc O
stopped O
it O
after O
6 O
months O
. O



 O
Totally O
clear O
until O
3 O
years O
ago O
and O
it O
came O
back O
on O
my O
scalp O
only O
. O

  O
I O
had O
lost O
my O
job O
so O
I O
hav O
to O
use O
topicals O
covered O
by O
Medicare O
which O
only O
worked O
sparingly O
. O



 O
I O
got O
a O
job O
in O
November O
and O
my O
dermatologist O
started O
the O
process O
of O
getting O
my O
insurance O
to O
cover O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
in O
February O
. O

  O
My O
guest O
dose O
arrived O
on O
Tuesday O
and O
I O
took O
it O
that O
day O
. O

 

 O
I O
keep O
looking O
in O
the O
mirror O
expecting O
to O
see O
a O
result O
now O
but O
I O
know O
it O
will O
happen O
and O
I O
have O
to O
be O
patient O

Thanks O
for O
posting O
this O
. O

I O
have O
my O
rheumatologist O
appointment O
at O
the O
end O
of O
Sept O
to O
check O
in O
and O
talk O
about O
this O
very O
thing O
. O

So O
I O
'm O
interested O
in O
any O
replies O
in O
this O
thread O
. O



 O
I O
've O
only O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
since O
June O
. O

I O
had O
great O
results O
the O
first O
injection O
and O
then O
it O
's O
slowly O
been O
less O
. O

I O
* O
am O
* O
feeling O
better O
compared O
to O
how O
I O
was O
before O
( O
pretty O
much O
house O
/ O
bed O
bound O
) O
but O
I O
still O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
stiffness B-ADR
and O
pain B-ADR
that O
restrict O
my O
activity O
levels O
a O
lot O
. O

It O
's O
frustrating O
. O


I O
was O
moved O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
Amgevita B-DRUG
which O
is O
a O
generic O
copy O
and O
had O
zero O
issues O
, O
this O
was O
around O
3 O
years O
ago O
. O

The O
Amgevita B-DRUG
pen O
is O
also O
far O
superior O
to O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
one O
and O
is O
so O
much O
nicer O
to O
use O
, O
never O
had O
a O
bruise B-ADR
from O
Amgevita B-DRUG
pens O
. O


If O
you O
do O
ever O
need O
to O
come O
up O
with O
a O
lie O
on O
the O
fly O
, O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
Adalimumab B-DRUG
are O
both O
drugs O
that O
can O
be O
given O
weekly O
as O
injections O
for O
rheumatoid B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
, O
or O
Crohn O
's O
disease O
- O
these O
are O
inflammatory O
diseases O
, O
and O
the O
drugs O
work O
on O
your O
immune O
system O
to O
help O
calm O
it O
down O
. O

They O
actually O
come O
as O
pre O
- O
filled O
syringes O
, O
but O
no O
- O
ones O
going O
to O
know O
that O
. O


I O
have O
n't O
taken O
Pentasa B-DRUG
for O
a O
long O
while O
but O
back O
when O
I O
did O
take O
it O
, O
it O
was O
about O
$ O
50 O
a O
month O
for O
my O
dosage O
. O

  O
I O
did O
n't O
take O
4 O
pills O
per O
day O
though O
, O
I O
believe O
it O
was O
2 O
. O

  O
This O
was O
around O
2013 O
- O
2014 O
. O

  O
Lialda B-DRUG
was O
similarly O
priced O
in O
2015 O
- O
2016 O
. O

  O
Then O
I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
the O
manufacturer O
offers O
copay O
assistance O
to O
where O
it O
only O
cost O
me O
$ O
5 O
for O
4 O
weeks O
of O
injections O
. O

  O
Now O
I O
'm O
on O
Stelara B-DRUG
and O
it O
's O
$ O
5 O
with O
copay O
assistance O
as O
well O
. O

 

 O
Obviously O
YMMV O
based O
on O
what O
insurance O
policy O
you O
end O
up O
with O
. O

  O
I O
'm O
on O
an O
Anthem O
Blue O
Cross O
Blue O
Shield O
PPO O
plan O
. O

  O
Back O
in O
2013 O
- O
2016 O
it O
would O
ve O
been O
United O
Health O
Care O
but O
the O
same O
type O
of O
plan O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
+ O
ileostomy B-DRUG
here O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
is O
my O
miracle O
drug O
. O

I O
bombed O
out O
of O
all O
the O
other O
meds O
, O
with O
varying O
levels O
of O
disasters O
- O
remicade B-DRUG
almost O
killed B-ADR
me O
. O



 O
I O
get O
the O
syringes O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
automatic O
devices O
, O
as O
those O
hurt O
like O
hell O
and O
leave O
MASSIVE O
bruises B-ADR
. O

Always O
go O
the O
belly O
/ O
mid O
section O
. O

Never O
the O
leg O
. O

They O
have O
changed O
the O
ingredients O
recently O
, O
and O
they O
do O
not O
burn B-ADR
like O
a O
mofo O
anymore O
- O
do O
n’t O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
sting B-ADR
, O
but O
not O
the O
hours O
long O
burn B-ADR
like O
it O
used O
to O
. O


I O
have O
found O
that O
by O
using O
the O
syringes O
you O
can O
control O
the O
delivery O
speed O
, O
which O
greatly O
reduces O
the O
discomfort B-ADR
. O


The O
humira B-DRUG
is O
also O
controlling O
my O
psoriatic B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
, O
psoriasis B-ADR
and O
Hidradenitis B-ADR
Suppurativa I-ADR
. O


It O
is O
used O
to O
treat O
different O
kind O
of O
inflammatory O
autoimmune B-ADR
diseases I-ADR
. O

Like O
Morbus O
Crohn O
or O
Morbus O
Bechterew O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
is O
the O
drug O
with O
the O
highest O
sales(turnover O
) O
in O
the O
world O
. O

In O
some O
regions O
, O
40 O
% O
of O
the O
people O
have O
such O
a O
disease O
and O
it O
does O
affect O
all O
ages O
. O



 O
Your O
immune O
system O
will O
destroy O
your O
own O
body O
. O

By O
creating O
inflammation B-ADR
at O
certain O
organs O
, O
tendons O
and O
joints O
. O

Since O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
cause O
of O
those O
diseases O
, O
they O
ca O
nt O
be O
cured O
. O

 

 O
NSAR O
medicaments O
can O
be O
used O
to O
temporarily O
cease O
inflammation B-ADR
. O

But O
its O
not O
effective O
, O
not O
healthy O
and O
not O
a O
long O
- O
term O
solution O
. O



 O
That O
's O
where O
TNF O
- O
alpha O
blockers O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Remicade B-DRUG
, O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
Simponi B-DRUG
and O
more O
will O
be O
used O
. O



 O
You O
basically O
shoot O
up O
antibody O
's O
, O
which O
then O
connect O
to O
the O
TNF O
- O
alpha O
( O
responsible O
for O
inflammation B-ADR
) O
and O
render O
them O
harmless O
. O

The O
goal O
is O
to O
weaken O
your O
immune O
system O
/ O
to O
suppress O
its O
activity O
. O

This O
leads O
to O
less O
suffering O
and O
prevents O
severe O
damage O
to O
joints O
and O
organs O
. O

With O
those O
medicaments O
you O
can O
live O
a O
more O
or O
less O
good O
life O
. O

Without O
? O

Big O
no O
:P O

Have O
RA O
and O
Humira B-DRUG
worked O
instantly O
for O
me O
. O

The O
day O
after O
I O
took O
it O
my O
pain B-ADR
and O
stiffness B-ADR
stopped O
and O
has O
n't O
come O
back O
. O

It O
's O
been O
1.5 O
years O
so O
far O
. O


I O
was O
on O
Imraldi B-DRUG
( O
same O
as O
Humira B-DRUG
) O
  O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
. O

It O
reduced O
my O
Calprotectin O
level O
to O
400 O
from O
1600 O
, O
but O
it O
then O
went O
up O
to O
900 O
so O
I O
've O
been O
put O
on O
Stelara B-DRUG
, O
although O
I O
did O
n't O
feel O
any O
worse O
. O


UK O
crohnie O
  O
- O
I O
was O
put O
on O
biologics O
immediately O
after O
being O
diagnosed O
. O

Initially O
the O
biosimilar O
Idacio B-DRUG
( O
adalimumab B-DRUG
) O
followed O
by O
Stelara B-DRUG
and O
now O
Entyvio B-DRUG
. O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
various O
parts O
of O
the O
UK O
, O
and O
my O
GI O
's O
have O
never O
suggested O
I O
try O
a O
non O
- O
biologic O
option O
. O

Perhaps O
ask O
your O
GI O
about O
your O
options O
. O

It O
's O
all O
available O
on O
the O
Crohns O
and O
Colitis B-ADR
website O
breaking O
down O
each O
type O
of O
medication O
. O

I O
was O
advised O
that O
the O
model O
of O
treatment O
nowadays O
is O
to O
' O
hit O
it O
hard O
' O
, O
by O
going O
to O
the O
top O
tier O
meds O
, O
rather O
than O
a O
phased O
approach O
of O
trial O
and O
error O
. O

Prednislone B-DRUG
is O
not O
usually O
a O
maintenance O
medication O
for O
Crohns O
- O
it O
's O
usually O
short O
term O
blast O
of O
just O
until O
your O
maintenance O
med O
is O
set O
up O
. O


I O
took O
prednisone B-DRUG
for O
several O
months O
to O
clear O
up O
the O
rash B-ADR
that O
appeared O
with O
my O
initial O
allergic B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
to O
Macrobid B-DRUG
and O
that O
did O
absolutely O
nothing O
for O
my O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
other O
symptoms O
but O
did O
clear O
up O
the O
rash B-ADR
. O



 O
I O
tried O
methotrexate B-DRUG
but O
I O
had O
a O
very O
bad O
reaction B-ADR
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
take O
it O
long O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
have O
any O
effect O
on O
the O
joint O
pain B-ADR
. O



 O
I O
started O
taking O
Gastrocrom B-DRUG
, O
and O
that O
has O
made O
a O
huge O
difference O
. O

I O
’m O
not O
sure O
if O
that O
’s O
because O
inflammatory B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
is O
mast O
cell O
mediated O
or O
because O
Gastrocrom B-DRUG
has O
an O
anti O
- O
inflammatory O
effect O
. O



 O
I O
’m O
in O
the O
northern O
hemisphere O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
weather O
started O
to O
get O
cold O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
relief O
. O

Hot O
weather O
and O
even O
electric O
blankets O
and O
heating O
pads O
unfortunately O
make O
my O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
much O
worse O
. O



 O
I O
am O
starting O
Humira B-DRUG
as O
soon O
as O
my O
prescription O
arrives O
, O
which O
might O
be O
this O
Wednesday O
. O


I O
was O
given O
the O
auto O
injector O
first O
and O
dreaded O
every O
second O
of O
trying O
to O
use O
it O
. O

The O
noise O
, O
the O
loss O
of O
control O
, O
the O
fear O
I O
’m O
going O
to O

lose O
a O
1000+$ O
dose O
. O

I O
could O
do O
it O
but O
I O
hated O
it O
. O


The O
pre O
loaded O
syringe O
was O
easier O
and O
less O
nerve O
wracking O
for O
me O
. O

Maybe O
that O
would O
be O
easier O
for O
you O
too O
? O


I O
was O
n’t O
sad O
when O
after O
several O
separate O
trials O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
with O
little O
benefits O
we O
switched O
to O
Remicade B-DRUG
infusions O
instead O
. O


My O
crohns O
revelation O
was O
like O
an O
intro O
to O
an O
episode O
of O
House O
MD O
. O

I O
came O
back O
from O
lunch O
and O
filled O
a O
toilet O
with O
blood O
🩸 O
( O
thought O
I O
was O
going O
to O
die O
) O
. O

Turns O
out O
I O
had O
lots O
of O
symptoms O
I O
ignored O
and O
one O
day O
the O
volcano O
erupted O
. O

Went O
to O
the O
ER O
and O
they O
found O
evidence O
of O
blood O
from O
up O
inside O
me O
. O

Insides O
looked O
pretty O
rough O
on O
the O
colonoscopy O
I O
had O
done O
shortly O
after O
that O
. O

Ulcers B-ADR
and O
mess O
, O
looked O
gnarly O
. O

Got O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
and O
felt O
amazing O
💪 O
🏻. O
I O
will O
say O
there O
are O
ups O
and O
downs O
. O

Remicade B-DRUG
eventually O
stopped O
working O
even O
with O
a O
dose O
increase O
and O
frequency O
increase O
. O

Went O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
which O
did O
n’t O
help O
all O
that O
much O
and O
I O
had O
side O
effects O
with O
. O

Currently O
on O
Entyvio B-DRUG
and O
I O
also O
take O
Florastor B-DRUG
when O
things O
get O
a O
little O
wonky O
. O

Good O
luck O
prayers O
up O
🙏 O
🏻 O

I O
called O
humira B-DRUG
within O
a O
year O
, O
remicade B-DRUG
in O
6 O
months O
( O
both O
due O
to O
developing O
antibodies O
) O
. O

Entyvio B-DRUG
never O
worked O
at O
all O
for O
me O
, O
and O
stelara B-DRUG
has O
been O
working O
since O
I O
started O
in O
June O
. O

While O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
common O
to O
fail O
the O
drugs O
, O
it O
certainly O
is O
n't O
uncommon O
. O


Thanks O
that O
’s O
a O
good O
point O
. O

I O
do O
have O
Iritis/ O
Uvitis O
and O
switched O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
from O
Enbrel B-DRUG
due O
to O
this O
. O

I O
can O
mention O
it O
to O
my O
doc O
. O


Yeah O
, O
it O
's O
room O
temp O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
did O
n't O
hurt O
like O
this O

She O
is O
still O
struggling O
to O
find O
remission O
. O

We O
've O
gone O
through O
Remicade B-DRUG
, O
Entyvio B-DRUG
, O
and O
she O
's O
now O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
we O
're O
adding O
methotrexate B-DRUG
. O

It O
sucks O
. O

How O
is O
your O
daughter O
? O


30F O
here O
- O
I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Orencia B-DRUG
, O
and O
now O
Taltz B-DRUG
. O

Still O
waiting O
to O
see O
if O
Taltz B-DRUG
will O
work O
for O
me O
. O

Regarding O
the O
injection O
pain B-ADR
, O
when O
I O
did O
my O
starting O
dose O
of O
Taltz B-DRUG
I O
cried O
it O
hurt B-ADR
so O
badly O
. O

The O
jabs O
have O
not O
gotten O
better O
for O
me O
, O
even O
with O
it O
being O
out O
of O
the O
fridge O
for O
over O
30 O
minutes O
. O

I O
need O
something O
to O
distract O
me O
while O
I O
do O
my O
shots O
now O
, O
like O
eating O
a O
piece O
of O
intense O
chocolate O
. O

Hope O
that O
you O
have O
some O
good O
luck O
with O
Taltz B-DRUG
. O


Yes O
on O
humira B-DRUG
eventually O
all O
the O
areas O
just O
stay O
drained B-ADR
and O
the O
inflammation B-ADR
disappears O
and O
the O
big O
ones O
flatten O
out O
. O

  O
After O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
wo O
it O
its O
so O
horrible O
again O
like O
constant O
drainage B-ADR
and O
odor B-ADR
. O

  O
The O
humira B-DRUG
made O
them O
drain O
so O
little O
i O
would O
rarely O
smell B-ADR
bad I-ADR
right O
now O
i O
have O
clean O
up O
like O
every O
2 O
hours O
at O
least O
and O
i O
ca O
nt O
stay O
ahead O
of O
the O
odor B-ADR
it O
truly O
is O
horrible O

I O
work O
in O
a O
warehouse O
and O
there O
was O
a O
shipping O
label O
mix O
up O
at O
the O
carrier O
hub O
and O
a O
spool O
of O
communication O
cable O
went O
to O
some O
guys O
house O
and O
his O
humira B-DRUG
got O
returned O
to O
us O
because O
it O
was O
n’t O
cable O
. O

  O
Open O
cooler O
and O
warm O
by O
the O
time O
I O
got O
it O
. O

   O
Me O
, O
trying O
to O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
because O
I O
know O
insurance O
will O
try O
to O
not O
pay O
the O
replacement O
and O
the O
invoice O
was O
a O
few O
thousand O
dollars O
, O
call O
them O
to O
let O
them O
know O
. O

  O
3 O
rounds O
of O
calls O
with O
escalating O
people O
there O
followed O
up O
by O
their O
legal O
department O
sending O
me O
forms O
to O
sign O
that O
I O
did O
not O
read O
any O
personal O
details O
( O
I O
really O
did O
n’t O
, O
I O
just O
got O
the O
order O
info O
to O
call O
them O
) O
and O
how O
long O
it O
was O
in O
my O
possession O
and O
finally O
I O
think O
it O
was O
resolved O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
worked O
great O
for O
me O
! O

I O
had O
no O
side O
effects O
other O
than O
the O
occasional O
bruise B-ADR
at O
the O
injection O
site O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
copay O
assistance O
program O
to O
work O
with O
your O
insurance O
, O
which O
eliminated O
all O
out O
- O
of O
- O
pocket O
costs O
for O
me O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
comes O
in O
the O
form O
of O
an O
autoinjector O
pen O
. O

It O
's O
literally O
just O
holding O
the O
pen O
against O
your O
skin O
and O
pressing O
a O
button O
. O

It O
's O
painless O
, O
and O
you O
do O
n't O
even O
see O
the O
needle O
unless O
you O
look O
really O
closely O
. O

[ O
Here](https://youtu.be O

ERFNcJa4CRE O
) O
is O
a O
very O
nice O
video O
about O
it O
( O
including O
some O
tips O
about O
the O
drug O
) O
. O


I O
'm O
in O
the O
US O
too O
. O

Its O
a O
type O
of O
medication O
that O
suppresses O
your O
immune O
system O
. O

I O
m O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
others O
though O
. O


No O
mesalamine B-DRUG
. O

Just O
humira B-DRUG

I O
'm O
immunocompromised O
and O
I O
wonder O
about O
this O
. O

Are O
antibodies O
transferrable O
? O

If O
so O
, O
can O
I O
just O
get O
a O
blood O
donation O
like O
, O
every O
month O
to O
keep O
my O
blood O
updated O
like O
a O
computer O
antivirus O
? O



 O
I O
'm O
seriously O
inquiring O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
pro O
vaccines O
. O

I O
get O
all O
my O
vaccines O
, O
I O
'm O
up O
to O
5 O
Moderna O
shots O
at O
this O
point O
plus O
yearly O
flu O
, O
plus O
pneumonia O
( O
I O
did O
n't O
even O
know O
that O
existed O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
found O
out O
it O
did O
, O
I O
got O
it O
) O
. O

I O
'm O
very O
very O
pro O
vaccine O
. O



 O
But O
yeah O
, O
I O
'm O
also O
on O
CellCept B-DRUG
and O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
lab O
tests O
show O
my O
immune O
system O
is O
basically O
back O
in O
the O
bunker O
playing O
xBox O
and O
eating O
Doritos O
. O



 O
So O
, O
I O
do O
wonder O
.... O
can O
I O
just O
get O
" O
dirty O
" O
blood O
on O
a O
regular O
basis O
? O

Normal O
humans O
with O
their O
immunizations O
and O
a O
functional O
immune O
system O
, O
will O
just O
keep O
replicating O
their O
defences O
. O

Can O
I O
' O
borrow O
' O
some O
immune O
soldiers O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
donor O
will O
be O
able O
to O
clone O
them O
in O
24 O
hours O
? O



 O
But O
also O
, O
if O
so O
, O
does O
that O
mean O
the O
anti O
vaxxers O
are O
correct O
and O
they O
can O
gain O
immunity O
from O
a O
transfusion O
? O


Like O
someone O
said O
above O
biologics O
treats O
the O
disease O
. O

I O
went O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
90 O
% O
of O
the O
pain B-ADR
ans O
swelling B-ADR
went O
away O
the O
next O
day O
. O

I O
m O
able O
to O
mountain O
bike O
and O
snowboard O
again O
. O

Mobility O
aids O
only O
adress O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
disease O
but O
not O
treat O
it O
. O

Better O
start O
biologics O
now O
and O
halt O
or O
slow O
down O
the O
RA O
or O
be O
crippled B-ADR
and O
be O
deformed B-ADR
by O
your O

humira B-DRUG
brand O
, O
I O
'm O
on O

Maybe O
ask O
your O
doctor O
about O
it O
and O
if O
it O
's O
lower O
in O
price O

has O
really O
strengthened O
my O

was O
fragile O
after O
4 O
years O
undiagnosed O

the O

You O

switched O
to O
Taltz B-DRUG

just O
stopped B-ADR
Otezla B-DRUG
as O
you O
can O

I O
was O

it O

clear O
my O

never O
touched O
the O

that O
uneasy B-ADR
feeling I-ADR
I O
would O
get O
was O
dreadful O
, O
so O
glad O
to O
be O
off O
it O
… O
hate O
the O
sting B-ADR
of O
the O

at O

I O

but O
that O
subsides O
after O
a O
few O
days O
post O

Good O
luck O
finding O
a O
good O
RX O
fit O
for O
you O
! O

! O


Yep O
.... O
I O
failed O
Remicade B-DRUG
which O
I O
did O
experience O
side O
effects O
while O
taking O
that O
biologic O
. O

My O
GI O
basically O
said O
that O
if O
I O
switched O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
I O
'd O
fail O
since O
it O
works O
similarly O
to O
Remicade B-DRUG
. O

My O
GI O
had O
2 O
clients O
in O
the O
hospital O
waiting O
to O
go O
the O
surgery O
route O
and O
both O
tried O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
while O
in O
the O
hospital O
, O
within O
a O
few O
days O
they O
were O
feeling O
much O
better O
, O
by O
a O
week O
, O
back O
to O
normal O
BM O
's O
. O

I O
only O
offer O
this O
as O
an O
option O
since O
it O
's O
a O
pill O
( O
super O
easy O
to O
take O
) O
, O
and O
your O
daughter O
having O
surgery O
might O
be O
tough O
to O
deal O
with O
at O
this O
point O
in O
her O
life O
. O

I O
guess O
, O
you O
both O
should O
decide O
, O
I O
just O
know O
this O
medication O
changed O
everything O
for O
me O
. O


If O
the O
adalimumab B-DRUG
does O
n't O
work O
, O
I O
'll O
ask O
, O
thanks O
! O


I O
got O
hep O
B O
vaccine O
before O
I O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

The O
pharmacist O
recommended O
I O
get O
that O
before O
starting O
it O
. O


My O
site O
got O
so O
big O
it O
wrapped O
around O
my O
leg O
. O

I O
went O
to O
a O
GP O
and O
he O
panicked O
because O
of O
how O
bad O
the O
swelling B-ADR
was O
and O
sent O
me O
to O
hospital O
. O

They O
called O
my O
rheumatologist O
who O
said O
I O
was O
reacting O
to O
the O
animal O
stuff O
in O
the O
shot O
. O

He O
recommended O
I O
take O
prednisone B-DRUG
the O
day O
before O
, O
the O
day O
of O
and O
the O
day O
after O
my O
shot O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
and O
it O
stopped O
happening O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
take O
the O
prednisone B-DRUG
anymore O
and O
It O
does O
n’t O
swell B-ADR
at O
all O
now O
and O
the O
humira B-DRUG
still O
works O
. O


She O
does O
n't O
seem O
like O
the O
type O
who O
would O
be O
very O
understanding O
. O

She O
was O
kind O
of O
rude O
. O

Did O
n't O
even O
explain O
to O
me O
that O
she O
would O
be O
putting O
me O
on O
drugs O
that O
'd O
affect O
my O
immunity O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
ask O
her O
more O
questions O
, O
but O
she O
wanted O
to O
do O
my O
testing O
first O
. O

Which O
would O
've O
been O
fine O
if O
she O
did O
n't O
then O
try O
to O
get O
me O
to O
start O
a O
medication O
before O
my O
next O
appointment O
. O

Her O
assistant O
just O
sent O
me O
drug O
information O
sheets O
in O
the O
mail O
and O
told O
me O
the O
doctor O
wanted O
me O
to O
choose O
which O
med O
I O
'd O
take O
. O



 O
So O
I O
thought O
it O
'd O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
ask O
some O
other O
people O
online O
first O
about O
how O
much O
it O
'd O
affect O
me O
doing O
activities O
I O
like O
. O

I O
asked O
my O
regular O
doctor O
about O
my O
concerns O
. O

He O
said O
he O
did O
n't O
have O
much O
experience O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
but O
knew O
AS O
would O
continue O
to O
get O
worse O
. O



 O
I O
'd O
have O
to O
look O
into O
my O
options O
as O
far O
as O
another O
rheumatologist O
. O

Hopefully O
my O
insurance O
would O
cover O
if O
a O
new O
rheumatologist O
wanted O
to O
redo O
the O
bloodwork O
. O


I O
am O
glad O
to O
hear O
you O
say O
how O
you O
responded O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

After O
my O
first O
dose O
, O
I O
felt O
almost O
like O
new O
the O
next O
day O
and O
it O
lasted O
about O
five O
days O
. O

But O
after O
that O
I O
got O
so O
much O
worse O
. O

I O
told O
my O
rheumatologist O
I O
thought O
Humira B-DRUG
was O
making O
me O
worse O
and O
he O
says O
it O
did O
not O
work O
that O
way O
. O

  O
Dismissed O
the O
possibility O
. O

  O
I O
really O
felt O
my O
body O
was O
fighting O
against O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


I O
was O
diagnosed O
at O
14 O
. O

Failed O
everything O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Steroids O
, O
antibiotics O
, O
Remicade B-DRUG
, O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Cimizia O
. O

After O
failing O
those O
, O
I O
had O
a O
resection O
surgery O
but O
it O
did O
n’t O
stop O
the O
symptoms O
at O
all O
. O

After O
that O
, O
I O
got O
on O
Entyvio B-DRUG
and O
it O
saved O
me O
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
on O
Entyvio B-DRUG
since O
2014 O
and O
I O
have O
not O
had O
a O
flare O
since O
. O

I O
still O
get O
some O
cramps B-ADR
, O
diarrhea B-ADR
, O
and O
pain B-ADR
here O
and O
there O
but O
it O
always O
goes O
away O
. O

Life O
saver O
for O
me O
. O

🤞 O
👍 O

I O
had O
the O
same O
response O
with O
my O
diagnosis O
. O

  O
My O
RA O
can O
on O
hard O
and O
fast O
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
have O
a O
pain B-ADR
in O
my O
body O
and O
within O
48 O
hours O
I O
could O
barely O
move O
my O
arms O
or O
hands O
from O
the O
pain B-ADR
. O

First O
I O
was O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
. O

  O
Then O
Cimzia B-DRUG
. O

Cimzia B-DRUG
took O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
to O
fully O
kick O
in O
. O

But O
it O
was O
a O
wonder O
drug O
for O
me O
for O
two O
years O
. O

I. O
has O
to O
go O
off O
it O
. O

When O
I O
got O
back B-ADR
on O
, O
it O
did O
n’t O
wor O
. O

Now O
I O
am O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
has O
helped O
. O

My O
life O
has O
changed O
. O

I O
avoid O
stress O
and O
pressure B-ADR
. O

I O
refuse O
to O
strain O
my O
hands O
or O
arms O
. O

So O
I O
ask O
for O
help O
now O
. O

And O
people O
do O
help O
. O

AS O
in O
good O
health O
. O

I O
’m O
on O
humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
took O
it O
one O
week O
before O
testing O
positive O
this O
June O
. O

Within O
12 O
hours O
from O
symptoms O
beginning O
, O
my O
fever B-ADR
rose O
by O
4 O
° O
and O
I O
was O
quickly O
developing O
severe O
respiratory O
symptoms O
. O

This O
was O
kind O
of O
surprising O
to O
my O
doctor O
even O
because O
of O
my O
age O
and O
otherwise O
good O
health O
. O

Paxlovid B-DRUG
caused O
an O
immediate O
reversal O
of O
the O
covid O
symptoms O
and O
rapid O
recovery O
. O

If O
nothing O
else O
, O
pax B-DRUG
is O
nifty O
for O
becoming O
negative O
so O
you O
can O
get O
back O
to O
life O
. O

I O
continued O
to O
test O
negative O
daily O
beginning O
on O
Day O
6 O
and O
onward O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
my O
healthy O
partner O
who O
only O
had O
mild O
symptoms O
stayed O
positive O
for O
nearly O
2 O
weeks O
. O

I O
had O
to O
skip O
one O
humira B-DRUG
dose O
due O
to O
covid O
- O
I O
did O
have O
a O
mild O
return O
of O
some O
AS O
symptoms O
in O
the O
following O
couple O
of O
weeks O
but O
these O
were O
nothing O
compared O
to O
the O
extreme O
AS O
pain B-ADR
I O
had O
during O
the O
covid O
fever B-ADR
. O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
took O
the O
next O
injection O
those O
AS O
symptoms O
went O
away O
so O
it O
’s O
worth O
it O
to O
skip O
a O
dose O
to O
get O
better O
from O
the O
covid O
. O

I O
’m O
not O
a O
doctor O
though O
so O
just O
for O
whatever O
they O
say O
:) O
good O
luck O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
’re O
back O
to O
normal O
quickly O

I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
almost O
two O
years O
. O

Never O
got O
fully O
clear O
and O
I O
had O
3 O
staph O
infections B-ADR
while O
on O
it O
. O

After O
my O
3rd O
staph O
my O
derm O
switched O
me O
to O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
and O
it O
’s O
a O
night O
and O
day O
difference O
. O

Definitely O
talk O
with O
your O
derm O
. O



 O
I O
still O
use O
topicals O
intermittently O
with O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
, O
but O
it O
’s O
nowhere O
near O
what O
it O
was O
when O
I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


I O
suspect O
he O
may O
want O
me O
to O
look O
into O
the O
surgery O
either O
way O
in O
case O
my O
eyes O
flare B-ADR
up O
while O
I O
’m O
on O
the O
immunosuppressants O
, O
but O
on O
the O
flip O
side O
, O
my O
pressures O
did O
come O
down O
again O
once O
I O
added O
even O
more O
classes O
of O
eye O
drops O
. O

So O
maybe O
I O
could O
avoid O
it O
. O



 O
For O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
did O
you O
have O
to O
fail O
another O
treatment O
first O
? O

And O
did O
you O
have O
any O
new O
inflammation B-ADR
while O
you O
waited O
for O
it O
to O
work O
! O

Honesty O
I O
think O
the O
Dr O
would O
be O
pleased O
if O
I O
said O
I O
was O
finally O
ready O
for O
meds O
. O

He O
’s O
been O
trying O
to O
accommodate O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
around O
all O
of O
this O
. O

It O
just O
sucks O
because O
I O
keep O
trying O
to O
make O
lifestyle O
changes O
that O
I O
hope O
will O
keep O
the O
inflammation B-ADR
away O
and O
taking O
something O
systemic O
almost O
feels O
like O
giving O
up O
. O


I O
was O
talking O
with O
a O
coworker O
about O
this O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
. O

He O
’s O
diabetic B-ADR
and O
takes O
insulin B-DRUG
, O
so O
he O
figures O
he O
’d O
be O
screwed O
fairly O
quick O
when O
that O
runs O
out O
. O



 O
I O
have O
a O
couple O
months O
of O
mesalamine B-DRUG
in O
reserve O
. O

I O
’m O
starting O
Humira B-DRUG
next O
week O
, O
so O
that O
would O
be O
off O
the O
table O
if O
the O
world O
melts O
down O
. O



 O
I O
suppose O
I O
could O
hold O
out O
for O
a O
while O
on O
mesalamine B-DRUG
rations O
before O
I O
eventually O
waste O
away O
to O
nothing O
or O
bleed O
to O
death B-ADR
. O



 O
I O
’m O
in O
an O
area O
that O
would O
n’t O
be O
too O
hard O
to O
‘ O
live O
off O
the O
land O
’ O
, O
so O
food O
and O
water O
would O
n’t O
be O
an O
immediate O
issue O
if O
it O
was O
n’t O
nuclear O
. O

Population O
here O
is O
low O
, O
as O
long O
as O
folks O
from O
the O
cities O
do O
n’t O
start O
heading O
this O
way O
. O



 O
If O
a O
nuke O
flies O
my O
way O
, O
I O
’d O
like O
to O
be O
close O
enough O
to O
see O
the O
flash O
and O
say O
‘ O
wow O
’ O
before O
I O
turn O
to O
dust O
rather O
than O
deal O
with O
trying O
to O
survive O
in O
a O
post O
apocalyptic O
world O
. O

If O
that O
happens O
, O
hopefully O
I O
can O
have O
a O
bottle O
of O
Jack O
Daniels O
in O
one O
hand O
and O
the O
biggest O
Cheech O
and O
Chong O
sized O
joint O
I O
can O
find O
in O
the O
other O
. O


This O
is O
encouraging O
. O

Are O
you O
still O
on O
it O
now O
? O



 O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
just O
straight O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

My O
insurance O
requires O
me O
to O
try O
a O
cheaper O
option O
first O
, O
which O
really O
scares O
me O
since O
I O
already O
have O
GI O
issues O
and O
those O
are O
known O
for O
messing O
up O
your O
stomach O
. O


The O
Taltz B-DRUG
shot O
used O
to O
hurt O
me O
unbelievably O
. O

  O
Then O
I O
found O
if O
I O
took O
it O
out O
of O
the O
refrigerator O
and O
let O
it O
sit O
on O
the O
counter O
for O
about O
an O
hour O
, O
and O
took O
a O
hot O
shower O
prior O
, O
and O
then O
gave O
the O
shot O
to O
myself O
, O
it O
was O
so O
much O
less O
painful O
. O

  O
Also O
, O
I O
have O
Gutate O
psoriasis B-ADR
and O
psoriatic B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
on O
Taltz B-DRUG
for O
about O
two O
years O
. O

“ O
Knock O
on O
wood O
” O
, O
but O
I O
’ve O
never O
had O
another O
breakout O
, O
although O
my O
arthritis B-ADR
is O
not O
any O
better O
and O
getting O
worse O
. O

  O
My O
Dermatologist O
& O
rheumatologist O
now O
have O
me O
also O
taking O
Hydroxychloroquine O
to O
try O
the O
combination O
of O
both O
. O

No O
luck O
yet O
on O
the O
arthritis B-ADR
but O
still O
hopeful O
. O

  O
Also O
prior O
to O
Taltz B-DRUG
I O
tried O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
had O
awful O
side O
effects O
. O

I O
also O
tried O
the O
light O
box O
, O
all O
the O
creams O
and O
everything O
else O
and O
nothing O
worked O
until O
the O
Taltz B-DRUG
. O


Good O
luck O
to O
you O
and O
I O
hope O
it O
continues O
to O
work O
. O


Hope O
it O
works O
! O

Take O
comfort O
in O
you O
’re O
braver O
than O
me O
. O

34 O
year O
old O
man O
just O
tentatively O
agreed O
to O
humira B-DRUG
because O
Stelara B-DRUG
starts O
with O
an O
infusion O
. O

Bold O
, O
italicize O
, O
highlight O
, O
underline O
and O
circle O
the O
word O
tentatively O
. O

Told O
my O
GI O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
start O
the O
approval O
process O
, O
I O
can O
be O
hard O
headed O
later O
🤣 O
. O

I O
’m O
scared O
to O
death B-ADR
of O
needles O
, O
I O
will O
climb O
the O
ceiling O
to O
avoid O
IVs O
and O
shots O
. O

They O
better O
at O
least O
bring O
a O
Reptar O
bandaid O
😂 O

I O
have O
ulcerative B-ADR
colitis I-ADR
, O
not O
crohns O
. O

I O
did O
n’t O
get O
psoriasis B-ADR
until O
I O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
though O
I O
did O
n’t O
get O
Humira B-DRUG
until O
my O
UC B-ADR
flare I-ADR
was O
really O
bad O
, O
so O
it O
’s O
hard O
to O
say O
which O
was O
most O
connected O
to O
the O
psoriasis B-ADR
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
on O
various O
biologics O
for O
maybe O
7 O
years O
or O
so O
now O
, O
and O
the O
psoriasis B-ADR
has O
n’t O
gone O
away O
. O



 O
I O
’m O
sure O
that O
’s O
not O
helpful O
to O
your O
situation O
, O
but O
I O
figured O
I O
’d O
comment O
as O
another O
person O
with O
IBD B-ADR
. O

I O
hope O
you O
’re O
feeling O
better O
and O
that O
they O
can O
find O
something O
to O
help O
your O
pain B-ADR
! O


I O
'm O
tired O
of O
dealing O
with O
my O
insurance O
always O
switching O
specialty O
pharmacies O
, O
and O
just O
dealing O
with O
injections O
and O
storing O
it O
. O

Plus O
humira B-DRUG
weakens O
your O
immune O
system O

I O
previously O
could O
not O
donate O
because O
I O
take O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
that O
limitation O
has O
also O
been O
removed O

  O
I O
took O
Accutane B-DRUG
when O
I O

20 O

I O

I O
did O
nt O

they O

HS O
with O
Accutane B-DRUG
I O
have O
to O
talk O
to O
my O
dr O
now O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
good O
question O
thank O
you O
for O
bringing O
it O
up O

7 O
years O
now O
. O

Took O
only O
a O
couple O
months O
on O
my O
first O
one O
for O
my O
skin O
to O
be O
mostly O
clear O
. O

I O
've O
since O
had O
to O
switch O
to O
multiple O
other O
biologics O
because O
my O
body O
built O
up O
an O
immunity B-ADR
to O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
then O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
and O
Taltz B-DRUG
. O

Some O
people O
stay O
on O
one O
forever O
though O
since O
it O
keeps O
working O

Passing O
this O
to O
my O
kids O
has O
always O
been O
my O
biggest O
fear O
since O
my O
diagnosis O
almost O
26 O
years O
ago O
. O

It O
is O
why O
I O
always O
wanted O
to O
participate O
in O
a O
trial O
to O
look O
for O
a O
cure O
, O
or O
better O
DMTs O
. O

I O
did O
that O
in O
2012 O
- O
2020 O
when O
I O
joined O
the O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
trial O
. O

In O
2015 O
my O
daughter O
at O
the O
time O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
Psoriasis B-ADR
and O
put O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
... O
which O
can O
cause O
MS B-ADR
to O
activate O
. O

I O
was O
terrified O
. O

She O
is O
now O
27 O
and O
luckily O
, O
she O
has O
changed O
meds O
and O
shows O
no O
signs O
of O
MS B-ADR
so O
far O
. O

It O
's O
bad O
enough O
I O
passed O
on O
Polycystic B-ADR
Kidney I-ADR
Disease O
to O
her O
( O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
diagnosed O
until O
the O
day O
she O
did O
and O
did O
n't O
know O
it O
ran O
in O
our O
family O
until O
then O
) O
. O

I O
'm O
still O
worried O
for O
both O
of O
my O
kids O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
is O
part O
of O
being O
a O
parent O
... O
no O
matter O
how O
old O
they O
get O
. O

 

 O
I O
'm O
so O
sorry O
about O
you O
daughter O
's O
diagnosis O
, O
and O
hope O
you O
can O
find O
peace O
in O
the O
future O
. O

It O
is O
not O
your O
fault O
, O
you O
did O
n't O
choose O
MS B-ADR
either O
. O

She O
's O
lucky O
to O
have O
you O
support O
her O
through O
the O
diagnosis O
process O
and O
get O
on O
treatment O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O


So O
sorry O
to O
hear O
about O
your O
AS O
. O

I O
have O
a O
family O
member O
who O
has O
found O
great O
relief O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
discount O
program O
if O
you O
reach O
out O
to O
the O
company O
directly O
! O


This O
is O
interesting O
, O
thank O
you O
for O
sharing O
this O
. O

Did O
you O
ever O
get O
hangovers B-ADR
on O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
every O
other O
week O
? O

I O
have O
n’t O
experienced O
that O
so O
far O
. O


Yeah O
, O
not O
sure O
where O
this O
is O
coming O
from O
- O
the O
chart O
provided O
along O
with O
the O
tweet O
just O
shows O
how O
many O
patients O
are O
moving O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
biosimilars O
over O
time O
, O
nothing O
about O
costs O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
Crohn O
's O
when O
I O
was O
20 O
. O

I O
was O
in O
my O
first O
year O
of O
university O
and O
I O
hugely O
empathise O
with O
how O
hard O
it O
is O
! O

I O
got O
around O
it O
by O
doing O
revision O
& O
studying O
at O
home O
and O
, O
although O
my O
crohn O
's O
remained O
severe O
throughout O
, O
I O
managed O
to O
graduate O
with O
a O
1st O
. O

Unfortunately O
life O
does O
n't O
pause O
for O
our O
health O
condition O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
mean O
you O
ca O
n't O
do O
things O
, O
you O
may O
just O
need O
to O
do O
things O
differently O
! O

This O
could O
mean O
asking O
to O
study O
in O
a O
room O
next O
to O
a O
toilet O
, O
waking O
up O
earlier O
( O
Crohn O
's O
may O
be O
more O
active O
in O
the O
first O
few O
hours O
you O
're O
up O
and O
about O
) O
or O
homeschooling O
until O
your O
symptoms B-ADR
are O

by O

( O
shortly O
after O

my O
crohn O

went O
into O

went O

the O

upwards O
of O
20 O
times O
a O

You O
'll O
get O
there O
, O
it O
can O
and O
does O
get O
better O
. O


Difficult O
to O
tell O
. O

I O
also O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
six O
months O
prior O
to O
the O
FMT O
plus O
my O
specialists O
say O
the O
biopsies O
indicate O
Crohns O
but O
it O
’s O
always O
been O
an O
“ O
indeterminate O
” O
diagnosis O
. O



 O
They O
admit O
it O
is O
too O
complicated O
to O
tell O
and O
I O
’m O
currently O
enrolled O
in O
a O
micro O
biome O

You O
have O
to O
go O
in O
at O
a O
45 O

get O
inject O
it O
in O
the O
subcutaneous O

 O
Not O
sure O
if O
you O
tried O
YouTube O
, O
but O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
videos O
that O
helped O
me O
as O
I O
was O
getting O
comfortable O
doing O
it O
on O
my O
own O
! O



 O
ETA O
this O
is O
by O
far O
the O
easiest O
biologic O
I O
've O
used O
. O

It O
's O
not O
painful O
at O
all O
imo O
and O
it O
's O
only O
every O
8 O
weeks O
( O
for O
most O
) O
. O

Unlike O
Humira B-DRUG
! O


Thank O
you O
so O
much O
, O
such O
a O
relief O
to O
hear O
I O
’m O

the O
only O

I O
’ve O
had O
3 O
in O
a O
matter O
of O
2 O
years O
. O

I O
’d O
been O
thinking O
about O
skipping O
DMARD O
’s O
and O
switching O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
or O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
did O
you O
notice O
weight B-ADR
gain I-ADR
with O
Humira B-DRUG
? O

If O
you O
do O
n’t O
mind O
me O
asking O
. O

I O
heard O
those O
can O
cause O
brain O
lesions O
as O
well O
which O
makes O
me O
nervous B-ADR
, O
but O
otherwise O
they O
’re O
great O
for O
a O
period O

I O
get O
it O
. O

I O
am O
on O
my O
5th O
biologic O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
, O
hoping O
I O
’m O
just O
having O
a O
winter O
flare B-ADR
up I-ADR
. O

Just O
doubled O
the O
dose O
due O
to O
persistent O
tendinitis B-ADR
outbreaks O
. O

No O
more O
TNF O
inhibitors O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Cimzia B-DRUG
me O
due O
to O
major O
infections B-ADR
. O


Is O
Humira B-DRUG
the O
same O
thing O
pretty O
much O
, O
just O
injectable O
? O


hey O
! O

great O
to O
hear O
from O
you O
and O
thank O
you O
for O
sharing O
your O
experiences O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
that O
it O
's O
working O
for O
you O
and O
hope O
you O
have O
doctors O
in O
your O
corner O
to O
help O
you O
navigate O
those O
choices O
. O

yeah O
, O
i O
'm O
hopeful O
humira B-DRUG
is O
the O
answer O
that O
gives O
me O
the O
best O
of O
both O
worlds O
! O

we O
'll O
see O
🤷 O

What O
is O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
injections O
? O

My O
doctor O
is O
tossing O
up O
if O
I O
should O
switch O
, O
I O
’ll O
know O
after O
my O
colonoscopy O
. O

Is O
stelara B-DRUG
also O
a O
pen O
like O
humira B-DRUG
? O


Humira B-DRUG
is O
not O
necessarily O
the O
best O
drug O
for O
UC O
. O

Certain O
meds O
are O
better O
than O
others O

Mine O
too O
! O

  O
I O
had O
psoriasis B-ADR
, O
and O
got O
on O
humira B-DRUG
in O
2019 O
which O
took O
care O
of O
that O
. O

  O
Flash O
forward O
to O
dev O
2021 O
( O
right O
before O
vaccines O
came O
out O
) O
and O
we O
got O

Covid O
and O
boom O
, O
my O
shoulder O
, O
knees O
and O
lower O
back O
were O
horrible O
. O

  O
I O
think O
I O
had O
glimmers O
of O
PsA O
before O
I O
got O
on O
humira B-DRUG
, O
but O
after O
having O
a O
fairly O
bad O
case O
of O
covid O
, O
the O
PsA O
came O
on O
strong O
! O



 O
It O
’s O
better O
now O
, O
a O
lot O
more O
under O
control O
. O

  O
I O
struggled O
with O
my O
knees O
, O
one O
in O
particular O
, O
but O
after O
a O
cortisone B-DRUG
shot O
in O
March O
, O
it O
’s O
made O
a O
huge O
difference O
! O

  O
Ca O
n’t O
run O
anymore O
, O
but O
hike O
and O
bike O
a O
lot O
. O


I O
totally O
get O
that O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
makes O
you O
gag O
. O

It O
's O
a O
nasty O
smelling O
pill O
and O
you O
have O
to O
take O
it O
so O
many O
times O
a O
day O
. O

It O
also O
takes O
so O
long O
to O
work O
it O
's O
maybe O
not O
even O
worth O
it O
. O

Have O
you O
tried O
methotrexate B-DRUG
? O

I O
have O
found O
it O
easier O
to O
tolerate O
( O
just O
as O
long O
as O
you O
take O
lots O
of O
folic B-DRUG
acid I-DRUG
) O
. O

The O
pills O
are O
smaller O
and O
it O
's O
once O
weekly O
too O
. O

You O
will O
have O
to O
take O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
if O
you O
are O
taking O
methotrexate B-DRUG
. O



 O
Rheumatologists O
normally O
transition O
one O
into O
Humira B-DRUG
while O
the O
patient O
is O
still O
taking O
a O
DMARD O
. O

At O
some O
point O
you O
might O
decide O
to O
stop O
taking O
it O
. O

However O
this O
is O
the O
main O
reason O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
RA O
has O
no O
starting O
dose O
. O

The O
prescribing O
information O
does O
mention O
starting O
at O
80 O
mg O
if O
the O
patient O
is O
not O
taking O
a O
DMARD O
. O


Do O
you O
use O
a O
biologic O
on O
top O
of O
the O
methotrexate B-DRUG
? O

I O
have O
psoriatic B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
along O
with O
my O
Crohns O
and O
I O
do O
Humira B-DRUG
injections O
as O
well O
. O

I O
’m O
currently O
pregnant O
so O
had O
to O
drop O
the O
MTX B-DRUG
and O
I O
’ve O
had O
a O
noticeable O
drop O
in O
energy O
( O
well O
being O
pregnant O
is O
a O
drain O
too O
) O
. O


I O
would O
nt O
worry O
about O
this O
too O
much O
. O

I O
do O
mine O
twice O
a O
week O
, O
alternating O
both O
sides O
of O
below O
the O
bellybutton O
( O
the O
same O
place O
you O
do O
, O
I O
assume O
) O
. O

I O
've O
done O
this O
since O
2016 O
. O

I O
even O
mark O
on O
the O
calendar O
- O
each O
Monday O
and O
Thursday O
- O
which O
side O
to O
inject O
on O
. O

I O
also O
take O
Humira B-DRUG
every O
other O
Thursday O
, O
so O
at O
least O
twice O
a O
month O
two O
of O
those O
T O
shots O
are O
on O
the O
same O
side O
in O
one O
week O
. O



 O
Never O
done O
it O
on O
the O
legs O
. O

Never O
any O
issues O
. O

I O
go O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
jabs O
and O
would O
ve O
noticed O
by O
now O
if O
there O
was O
a O
problem O
. O

Just O
keep O
switching O
sides O
every O
time O
and O
you O
should O
be O
fine O
. O

If O
there O
is O
nt O
enough O
fat O
on O
the O
legs O
then O
do O
nt O
use O
em O
. O



 O
Some O
guys O
do O
intramuscular O
just O
fine O
, O
but O
there O
's O
no O
* O
need O
* O
to O
. O

It O
used O
to O
be O
the O
assumed O
default O
method O
, O
but O
the O
standard O
of O
care O
has O
been O
changing O
. O

According O
to O
the O
doctor O
I O
saw O
this O
month O
, O
the O
prevailing O
attitude O
is O
shifting O
away O
from O
the O
intramuscular O
method O
. O

Subq O
is O
equally O
effective O
( O
and O
some O
would O
say O
even O
moreso O
) O
  O
less O
painful B-ADR
, O
and O
less O
risky O
. O

My O
ex O
roommate O
has O
permanent O
scarring B-ADR
and O
muscle B-ADR
damage I-ADR
in O
his O
leg O
from O
intramuscular O
shots O
gone O
wrong O
, O
and O
you O
could O
nt O
pay O
me O
to O
ever O
start O
. O

Thankfully O
, O
there O
's O
no O
reason O
to O
. O



 O
I O
had O
the O
same O
concern O
when O
I O
started O
the O
shots O
though O
, O
like O
was O
I O
just O
going O
to O
be O
constantly O
pricking O
holes O
in O
my O
stomach O
that O
never O
heal O
? O

I O
was O
assured O
( O
by O
a O
very O
amused O
doctor O
) O
that O
they O
heal O
very O
fast O
, O
too O
fast O
for O
it O
to O
matter O
at O
all O
. O


$ O
8k O
is O
nothing O
. O

My O
wife O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
one O
time O
an O
old O
guy O
at O
the O
pharmacy O
was O
whining O
about O
paying O
his O
$ O
20 O
co O
- O
pay O
on O
his O
fixed O
income O
, O
so O
my O
wife O
showed O
the O
guy O
her O
$ O
25k O
Humira B-DRUG
bill O
and O
he O
shut O
right O
the O
fuck O
up O
. O

Granted O
, O
she O
did O
n't O
actually O
pay O
that O
, O
but O
uninsured O
or O
uninformed O
, O
yeah O
, O
impossible O
to O
obtain O
. O

It O
's O
stupid O
what O
these O
companies O
get O
away O
with O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
many O
of O
them O
offer O
rebate O
cards O
that O
let O
you O
get O
them O
for O
pennies O
on O
the O
dollar O
, O
but O
it O
's O
still O
ridiculous O
. O


Has O
your O
doctor O
checked O
a O
humira B-DRUG
blood O
level O
? O

That O
could O
be O
a O
faster O
way O
to O
prove O
the O
humira B-DRUG
is O
n’t O
working O

I O
'm O
also O
on O
biological O
too O
I O
started O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
had O
to O
graduate O
to O
a O
stronger O
one O
. O

Glad O
they O
are O
finding O
relief O
! O

If O
you O
start O
biologics O
early O
enough O
you O
can O
avoid O
becoming O
fused O
like O
I O
am O
. O

Make O
sure O
that O
are O
as O
active O
as O
they O
can O
bear O
! O


Do O
you O
have O
a O
nurse O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
? O

If O
not O
I O
would O
definitely O
call O
abbie O
vie O
and O
let O
them O
know O
what O
you O
’re O
experiencing O
because O
it O
sounds O
like O
an O
allergic B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
. O


You O
miss O
read O

Did O
not O
say O
that O
about O

many O

still O
take O

perhaps O
get O
it O
through O
an O
IMSS O
clinic O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
daughter O
are O
Mexican O
so O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
exactly O
how O
you O
could O
do O
that O
but O
a O
lawyer O
might O
be O
able O
to O
walk O
you O
through O
residency O
permits O
and O
then O
the O
possibility O
of O
applying O
to O
services O
after O
that O
. O

Emphasis O
there O
on O
" O
possibility O
, O
" O
I O
do O
n’t O
know O
that O
anyone O
has O
a O
roadmap O
to O
this O
. O



 O
Getting O
a O
prescription O
and O
filling O
it O
probably O
is O
not O
the O
problem O
, O
it O
's O
just O
paying O
out O
of O
pocket O
for O
it O
? O

I O
'd O
look O
into O
health O
care O
plans O
for O
people O
living O
abroad O
or O
digital O
nomads O
. O

You O
will O
almost O
certainly O
pay O
cash O
and O
then O
get O
reimbursed O
. O



 O
Another O
thing O
she O
might O
look O
into O
is O
alternative O
drugs O
— O
  O
it O
's O
none O
of O
my O
business O
if O
this O
is O
for O
psoriasis B-ADR
or O
Crohn O
's O
or O
whatever O
but O
I O
do O
know O
quite O
a O
lot O
about O
autoimmune O
disorder O
drugs O
having O
to O
take O
one O
myself O
. O

The O
latest O
( O
and O
most O
expensive O
) O
always O
seems O
like O
the O
greatest O
until O
30 O
years O
of O
data O
builds O
up O
then O
it O
just O
looks O
kind O
of O
meh O
. O


I O
have O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
over O
a O
year O
with O
no O
relief O
, O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
on O
and O
off O
( O
which O
I O
also O
hate O
) O
. O

I O
’ve O
felt O
so O
hopeless O
and O
sick B-ADR
. O

I O
am O
currently O
waiting O
to O
be O
approved O
for O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
. O

Also O
taking O
a O
low O
dose O
of O
the O
Naltrexone O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
with O
prednisone B-DRUG
, O
and O
I O
am O
finding O
some O
relief O
by O
taking O
it O
during O
the O
day O
. O

Tried O
it O
at O
night O
and O
had O
severe O
insomnia B-ADR
, O
so O
I O
do O
n’t O
recommend O
. O


Great O
, O
with O
all O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
dexamethasone B-DRUG
and O
surgery O
. O


My O
fiancé O
never O
had O
anything O
else O
prescribed O
to O
him O
other O
than O
Taltz B-DRUG
and O
humira B-DRUG
and O
when O
the O
bad O
side O
effects O
began O
, O
some O
almost O
instant O
each O
dermatologist O
said O
it O
’s O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
… O
I O
wish O
we O
be O
of O
them O
would O
have O
listened O
and O
tried O
to O
help O
and O
educate O
us O
on O
different O
options O
. O


Thanks O
. O

We O
've O
burned O
through O
Remicade B-DRUG
, O
Entyvio B-DRUG
, O
and O
Humira B-DRUG
in O
less O
than O
18 O
months O
, O
and O
she O
had O
pretty O
bad O
side O
effects O
from O
each O
, O
especially O
Remicade B-DRUG
and O
Entyvio B-DRUG
. O

We O
were O
hoping O
Humira B-DRUG
might O
be O
it O
but O
she O
never O
fully O
went O
into O
remission O
even O
at O
max O
dose O
. O

She O
's O
done O
and O
wants O
the O
surgery O
because O
she O
's O
tired O
of O
being O
miserable-- O
and O
I O
get O
it O
. O

I O
do O
think O
she O
has O
no O
idea O
what O
this O
surgery O
will O
involve O
but O
she O
's O
so O
miserable O
. O

She O
's O
been O
hospitalized O
14 O
times O
since O
diagnosis O
in O
2021 O
. O

Insane O

Hi O
, O
just O
curious O
how O
you O
've O
gotten O
on O
? O

With O
reactive B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
, O
is O
the O
plan O
to O
taper O
off O
of O
humira B-DRUG
as O
well O
? O


What O
? O

Mine O
wouldcost O
644 O
€ O
per O
month O
, O
but O
insurance O
covers O
it O
. O

  O
Mine O
is O
biosimilar O
to O
Humira B-DRUG

Diagnosed O
at O
12 O
, O
although O
my O
first O
flare O
I O
remember O
in O
the O
1st O
grade O
, O
now O
I O
'm O
almost O
44 O
and O
currently O
in O
a O
flare B-ADR
over O
the O
past O
year O
. O

On O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
hoping O
they O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
go O
to O
weekly O
. O


Are O
you O
in O
the O
U.S. O
? O

What O
insurance O
company O
? O

I O
'm O
surprised O
they O
are O
making O
these O
decisions O
already O
. O

Not O
sure O
it O
will O
help O
but O
I O
am O
involved O
in O
drug O
development O
professionally O
and O
I O
think O
the O
generic O
Humira B-DRUG
will O
work O
the O
same O
as O
the O
original O
. O

I O
am O
also O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
assume O
I O
will O
be O
switched O
eventually O
, O
and O
I O
will O
be O
OK O
with O
it O
. O


How O
will O
I O
feel O
in O
6 O
months O
? O

I O
'll O
let O
you O
know O
. O

Maybe O
back O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
😭 O
😭 O
. O


Ah O
, O
shoot O
. O

Stelara B-DRUG
! O

That O
’s O
another O
one O
I O
’ve O
vaguely O
heard O
of O
. O

I O
’m O
sorry O
you O
’re O
going O
through O
this O
and O
I O
struggle O
with O
the O
exact O
same O
pains O
. O

I O
’m O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
with O
pretty O
good O
luck O
so O
far O
. O

I O
know O
it O
ca O
n’t O
last O
forever O
. O

Also O
at O
the O
end O
of O
my O
wits O
with O
my O
rheumatologist O
that O
is O
basically O
checked O
out O
. O

I O
’ve O
also O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
success O
with O
cannabis B-DRUG
for O
pain B-ADR
. O

Especially O
finding O
ones O
that O
work O
for O
tendons O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
has O
been O
crucial O
! O


I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
a O
decade O
( O
now O
I O
’m O
on O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
for O
purely O
insurance O
reasons O
) O
and O
did O
not O
take O
any O
special O
regard O
with O
my O
immune O
system O
. O

I O
eat O
raw O
fish O
regularly O
, O
had O
steak O
tartare O
, O
swim O
in O
lakes O
, O
streams O
, O
and O
the O
ocean O
, O
went O
backpacking O
up O
a O
mountain O
and O
drank O
water O
through O
a O
filter O
out O
of O
a O
stream O
and O
slept O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
garden O
with O
my O
bare O
hands O
and O
get O
them O
all O
cut O
up O
, O
ride O
public O
transit O
and O
go O
to O
super O
crowded O
places O
, O
eat O
from O
street O
vendors O
, O
periodically O
let O
my O
dogs O
lick O
my O
mouth O
, O
travel O
to O
other O
countries O
and O
drink O
their O
water O
, O
and O
basically O
whatever O
else O
I O
want O
with O
little O
concern O
. O



 O
Just O
use O
common O
sense O
, O
wash O
your O
hands O
, O
do O
n’t O
touch O
your O
eye O
or O
mouth O
after O
touching O
all O
sorts O
of O
unsavory O
things O
, O
clean O
off O
and O
properly O
treat O
cuts O
and O
scrapes O
at O
the O
next O
convenient O
opportunity O
to O
do O
so O
, O
etc O
. O



 O
I O
understand O
this O
is O
scary O
for O
you O
, O
but O
you O
can O
live O
a O
normal O
life O
while O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Talk O
to O
your O
doctors O
about O
your O
concerns O
and O
trust O
their O
advice O
. O


I O
'm O
47 O
and O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
previously O
. O



 O
The O
only O
side O
effect O
that O
I O
had O
was O
some O
fatigue B-ADR
after O
my O
first O
couple O
of O
doses O
. O

Th3 O
effectiveness O
for O
me O
was O
amazing O
, O
but O
each O
person O
reacts O
differently O
. O



 O
I O
got O
about O
18 O
good O
months O
out O
of O
it O
, O
but O
some O
people O
get O
years O
before O
their O
body O
develops O
antibodies O
to O
it O
and O
it O
becomes O
less O
effective O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
on O
another O
biologic O
in O
the O
same O
class O
( O
Simponi B-DRUG
) O
for O
about O
14 O
months O
now O
and O
no O
hint O
of O
it O
slowing O
down O
( O
I O
better O
not O
jinx O
myself O
, O
lol O
) O
. O


My O
insurance O
changed O
in O
oct O
2021 O
and O
it O
sucked O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
I O
did O
n’t O
have O
to O
get O
a O
new O
rheum O
but O
I O
had O
to O
re O

ended O
up O
missing O
3 O
doses O
. O

My O
rheum O
never O
has O
samples O
so O
I O
was O
SOL O
. O



 O
The O
best O
part O
was O
when O
setting O
up O
the O
new O
specialty O
pharmacy O
EVERY O
SINGLE O
person O
I O
talked O
to O
on O
the O
phone O
expressed O
their O
concern O
about O
missed O
doses O
. O

I O
know O
it O
’s O
not O
their O

’re O
forced O

navigate O
this O

The O

- O
term O
sems O
reasonable O
. O

Adalimumab B-DRUG
should O
be O
reserved O
for O
those O
that O
are O
not O
adequately O
antibiotic O
responsive O
, O
and O
many O
of O
my O
patient O
require O
multiple O
treatments O
beyond O
these O
two O
. O


I O
’m O
wondering O
if O
upping O
the O
dosage O
would O
help O
, O
but O
will O
ask O
my O
doctor O
next O
week O
. O

   O
I O
guess O
if O
this O
does O
n’t O
work O
, O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
next O
? O

Then O
rinvoq B-DRUG

I O
'm O
in O
the O
exact O
same O
boat O
. O

I O
had O
been O
on O
80 O
mg O
per O
day O
when O
they O
could O
n't O
perform O
my O
resection O
for O
almost O
a O
year O
( O
due O
to O
COVID O
) O
, O
which O
did O
cause O
it O
's O
own O
problems O
. O

However O
, O
at O
least O
I O
was O
functioning O
and O
pretending O
to O
have O
an O
abbreviated O
life O
post O
- O
surgery O
and O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Then O
they O
tapered O
me O
off O
to O
do O
a O
camera O
- O
endoscopy O
, O
and O
I O
completely O
crashed O
. O

I O
was O
in O
bed O
for O
more O
than O
four O
weeks O
, O
even O
after O
a O
2.5 O
mg O
taper O
every O
two O
weeks O
. O

And O
now O
I O
'm O
flaring O
left O
and O
right O
and O
they O
've O
rescheduled O
the O
camera O
scope O
AGAIN O
for O
January O
. O

I O
just O
started O
taking O
it O
again O
, O
10 O
mg O
, O
on O
Saturday O
, O
because O
I O
've O
been O
in O
bed O
since O
the O
day O
after O
Thanksgiving O
. O

This O
disease O
is O
a O
nightmare B-ADR
. O


My O
humira B-DRUG
injections O
are O
$ O
6,800 O
. O

I O
am O
at O
a O
meh O
baseline O
and O
can O
not O
work O
because O
I O
can O
not O
afford O
$ O
10,000 O
, O
out O
of O
pocket O
, O
infusion O
. O

If O
we O
had O
access O
to O
universal O
healthcare O
, O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
infusions O
and O
be O
able O
to O
work O
. O

That O
is O
one O
more O
person O
in O
the O
workplace O
, O
paying O
taxes O
. O

I O
know O
there O
would O
be O
plenty O
of O
others O
that O
could O
work O
instead O
of O
relying O
on O
disability O
. O



 O
Giving O
people O
access O
to O
universal O
healthcare O
, O
to O
fix O
the O
problem O
before O
it O
spirals O
so O
far O
out O
of O
control O
that O
they O
are O
finally O
forced O
to O
see O
a O
doctor O
, O
would O
be O
way O
more O
cost O
- O
efficient O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O


I O
work O
with O
reptiles O
and O
do O
similar O
stuff O
. O

Interned O
at O
an O
aquarium O
when O
I O
was O
starting O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Most O
zoonotic O
diseases O
you O
need O
to O
ingest O
or O
get O
in O
the O
blood O
stream O
, O
so O
I O
just O
do O
n’t O
lick O
my O
fingers O
when O
I O
have O
gross O
animal O
stuff O
on O
them O
and O
wash O
hands O
real O
good O
. O


I O
worry O
more O
about O
stuff O
from O
other O
people O
. O

Someone O
brought O
up O
community O
pools O
and O
showers O
, O
those O
are O
probably O
smart O
to O
avoid O
. O

I O
think O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
being O
vigilant O
. O

Everyone O
gets O
infections B-ADR
, O
but O
if O
you O
’re O
immunocompromised O
you O
need O
to O
be O
more O
ready O
to O
seek O
help O
. O


Anyway O
, O
the O
immunosuppression O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
significant O
but O
very O
targeted O
. O

It O
is O
n’t O
as O
intense O
as O
stuff O
like O
Rituxan B-DRUG
, O
Imuran B-DRUG
, O
or O
steroids O
. O


Anecdotally O
, O
I O
did O
a O
week O
long O
sea O
turtle O
field O
research O
thing O
with O
a O
transplant O
patient O
. O

He O
does O
it O
every O
year O
. O

There O
are O
immunocompromised O
people O
who O
work O
with O
animals O
for O
sure O
, O
just O
got O
ta O
be O
a O
little O
more O
careful O
. O

Aka O
, O
probably O
as O
careful O
as O
everyone O
should O
be O
, O
but O
is O
n’t O
, O
lol O
. O


Edit O
: O
I O
would O
say O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
lymph O
node O
thing O
first O
tho O
. O

Basically O
you O
do O
n’t O
want O
to O
be O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
with O
an O
infection B-ADR
or O
cancer B-ADR
. O

I O
’m O
currently O
taking O
a O
break O
from O
it O
due O
to O
COVID O
( O
which O
I O
got O
from O
the O
damn O
dentist O
after O
dodging O
for O
all O
this O
time O
, O
and O
4 O
vaccine O
doses O
. O

) O

I O
was O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
when O
I O
was O
taking O
it O
everyday O
. O

But O
my O
primary O
told O
me O
I O
should O
stop O
taking O
it O
everyday O
if O
I O
was O
n’t O
having O
constant O
symptoms O
. O

I O
was O
eventually O
switched O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
I O
only O
took O
it O
when O
I O
had O
the O
symptoms O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
take O
it O
now O
as O
I O
no O
longer O
have O
it O
😊 O
hope O
that O
helps O
! O


Do O
you O
think O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
helped O
with O
your O
acid B-ADR
reflux I-ADR
or O
just O
coincidence O
? O


I O
'm O
taking O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
, O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
morphine O
. O

I O
can O
not O
use O
NSAIDs O
. O

I O
just O
switched O
Humira B-DRUG
from O
every O
other O
week O
to O
every O
week O
. O

This O
weekend O
was O
the O
best O
i O
ve O
felt O
in O
a O
year O
. O



 O
I O
've O
gone O
from O
just O
walking O
to O
using O
a O
cane O
to O
using O
a O
walker O
to O
using O
a O
wheelchair O
when O
I O
am O
outside O
of O
the O
house O
. O

I O
can O
get O
around O
in O
my O
small O
house O
using O
counters O
and O
tables O
to O
prop O
myself O
up O
, O
but O
outside O
of O
the O
house O
I O
need O
more O
help O
. O

Since O
I O
felt O
better O
this O
weekend O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
use O
the O
walker O
in O
places O
in O
which O
I O
would O
have O
needed O
the O
wheelchair O


 O
The O
cane O
caused O
more O
issues O
than O
it O
helped O
. O

The O
walker O
alleviated O
those O
issues O
, O
but O
eventually O
it O
got O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
had O
to O
get O
a O
wheel O
chair O
. O

I O
never O
even O
talked O
to O
my O
doctor O
about O
these O
things O
. O

I O
needed O
them O
. O

So O
, O
I O
got O
them O
. O



 O
Point O
is O
, O
use O
it O
if O
you O
feel O
you O
need O
to O
, O
but O
definitely O
consider O
what O
your O
doctors O
say O
. O

They O
are O
experts O
after O
all O
. O


I O
hope O
my O
daughter O
does O
n’t O
have O
to O
go O
one O
prednisone B-DRUG
again O
. O

The O
side O
effects O
are O
not O
ideal O
, O
though O
it O
did O
it O
’s O
job O
. O

Good O
luck O
with O
the O
humira B-DRUG
, O
I O
hope O
it O
works O
for O
you O
! O


Vitamin B-DRUG

, O
vitamin B-DRUG
B I-DRUG
complex I-DRUG
because O
of O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
multivitamin O
. O

  O
I O
am O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
methotrexate B-DRUG
. O


I O
tried O
several O
different O
things O
. O

Nothing O
has O
worked O
. O

Closest O
thing O
to O
success O
I O
guess O
would O
be O
Biologics O
. O

I O
tried O
Humira B-DRUG
injections O
for O
12 O
weeks O
. O

Did O
n’t O
think O
it O
worked O
until O
I O
stopped O
. O

Now O
I O
think O
YES O
it O
was O
working O
. O

Maybe O
try O
Enbrel B-DRUG
or O
Humira B-DRUG
or O
Remicade B-DRUG
shots O
… O
just O
a O
thought O
. O

They O
’re O
the O
best O
, O
most O
advanced O
drugs O
for O
RA O
. O

Good O
luck O
to O
you O
. O


I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
6ish O
month O
maybe O
longer O
and O
it O
worked O
for O
maybe O
3 O
- O
4 O
months O
. O

I O
’m O
now O
starting O
my O
Entyvio B-DRUG
infusions O
( O
second O
one O
is O
on O
Aug O
2nd O
) O
. O

Entyvio B-DRUG
has O
a O
high O
success O
rate O
for O
going O
into O
remission O
but O
remember O
everyone O
’s O
body O
is O
different O
meaning O
one O
thing O
may O
work O
for O
some O
else O
and O
another O
may O
not O
work O
for O
you O
etc O
. O


Yes O
. O

Methotrexate B-DRUG
did O
n’t O
work O
for O
me O
and O
the O
others O
would O
only O
mainly O
deal O
with O
my O
arthritis B-ADR
not O
P O
so O
my O
sermon O
( O
private O
) O
said O
to O
get O
on O
taltz B-DRUG
or O
humira B-DRUG
via O
the O
nhs O
so O
I O
had O
to O
fail O
2 O
but O
they O
made O
me O
try O
a O
third O
. O

Neither O
of O
which O
I O
took O
so O
my O
nhs O
doctor O
is O
for O
arthritis B-ADR
only O
. O

Does O
n’t O
make O
sense O
to O
take O
something O
that O
only O
treats O
one O
when O
I O
can O
get O
something O
to O
treat O
both O
. O



 O
Question O
, O
if O
I O
may O
, O
does O
humira B-DRUG
have O
any O
or O
bad O
side O
effects O
? O

I O
start O
the O
injections O
any O
day O
now O
. O


Diagnosed O
at O
11 O
, O
now O
23 O
, O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
azathioprine B-DRUG
since O
2016 O
and O
working O
so O
far O

There O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
these O
days O
. O

  O
I O
'd O
ask O
whether O
you O
are O
comfortable O
with O
home O
injections O
, O
and O
do O
infusion O
centers O
have O
good O
times O
where O
you O
could O
get O
infusions O
after O
work O
/ O
school O
on O
weekends O
, O
etc O
, O
? O

 

 O
Traditionally O
you O
started O
with O
remicade B-DRUG
or O
humira B-DRUG
( O
sister O

. O

Some O
are O
choosing O

2 O
years O
ago O
and O
they O
put O
me O
on O
azathioprine B-DRUG

they O
thought O
that O
would O
do O
the O
trick O
but O
it O
actually O
did O
nothing O
and O
my O
Crohn O
’s O
kept O
getting O
worse O
so O
now O
I O
’m O
going O
to O
be O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG

so O
I O
would O
say O
to O
just O
keep O
checking O
in O
and O
if O
you O
’re O
Crohn O
’s O
keeps O

worse O
talk O
to O
somebody O
because O
it O
’s O
better O
to O
act O
sooner O
than O
later O

Did O
they O
refuse O
to O
put O
you O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
even O
after O
a O
positive O
HLA O
test O
? O

That O
’s O
my O
fear O
is O
that O
the O
rheumatologist O
is O
going O
to O
say O
“ O
keep O
taking O
NSAID O
’s O
it O
’s O
not O
bad O
enough O
yet O
” O
. O

I O
ca O
n’t O
even O
function O
through O
the O
day O
without O
taking O
nsaids O
multiple O
times O
per O
day O
and O
even O
then O
it O
’s O
a O
struggle O
. O


Biologics O
that O
failed O
me O
: O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Stelara B-DRUG
, O
Inflectra B-DRUG
, O
Entyvio B-DRUG
. O


On O
Jyseleca B-DRUG
since O
March O
which O
helps O
but O
I O
'm O
not O
100 O
% O
. O

Could O
be O
due O
to O
undiagnosed O
IBS B-ADR
. O



 O
Good O
luck O
with O
your O

I O
wish O

Hello O
, O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
get O
Humira B-DRUG
prescribed O
for O
me O
too O
. O

My O
doc O
want O
me O
to O
try O
oral O
steroid O
Otzela O
first O
but O
I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
try O
. O

Do O
you O
know O
if O
we O
would O
never O
get O
psoriasis B-ADR
after O
Humira B-DRUG
treatment O
or O
does O
it O
come O
back O
after O
you O
stop O
dozes O
or O
may O
be O
after O
a O
year O
. O


I O
had O
it O
before O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
knocked O
me O
out O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O

def O
call O
your O
doctor O
and O
the O
humira B-DRUG
nurse O

I O
actually O
have O
a O
similar O
story O
with O
humira B-DRUG
, O
it O
worked O
great O
for O
the O
first O
3 O
months O
but O
never O
fully O
cleared O
my O
psoriasis B-ADR
up O
. O

then O
it O
slowly O
started O
coming O
back O
until O
it O
just O
was O
n't O
working O
at O
all O
. O


I O
know O
they O
do O
say O
to O
wait O
16 O
weeks O
though O
so O
hopefully O
it O
will O
keep O
on O
getting O
better O
! O


I O
’ve O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
almost O
a O
year O
now O
. O

I O
noticed O
that O
I O
was O
starting O
to O
feel O
better O
4 O
months O
in O
and O
by O
6 O
I O
was O
starting O
to O
do O
all O
the O
things O
! O

I O
had O
to O
build O
strength O
back O
and O
that O
has O
taken O
some O
time O
. O

I O
also O
needed O
physical O
therapy O
to O
correct O
some O
issues O
that O
developed O
due O
to O
being O
inactive O
when O
my O
symptoms O
began O
and O
I O
was O
pursuing O
a O
diagnosis O
. O

I O
actually O
just O
went O
back O
to O
work O
this O
week O
! O



 O
I O
get O
what O
I O
’ve O
seen O
referred O
to O
as O
‘ O
Humira B-DRUG
hangover B-ADR
’ O
where O
I O
feel O
incredibly O
fatigued B-ADR
and O
gross O
after O
my O
injection O
, O
so O
I O
inject O
right O
before O
bed O
or O
within O
an O
hour O
before O
bed O
before O
side O
effects O
start O
and O
sleep O
through O
them O
. O

Since O
switching O
to O
taking O
it O
at O
bedtime O
, O
I O
have O
n’t O
noticed O
any O
side O
effects O
. O



 O
The O
injection O
is O
painless O
. O

I O
inject O
in O
my O
stomach O
and O
rotate O
between O
the O
left O
and O
right O
sides O
. O

Your O
doctors O
office O
should O
have O
you O
come O
in O
for O
your O
first O
injection O
so O
they O
can O
show O
you O
what O
to O
do O
. O



 O
As O
far O
as O
precautions O
go O
, O
I O
’m O
careful O
about O
hand O
washing O
especially O
after O
being O
in O
public O
, O
and O
I O
’ve O
told O
friends O
and O
family O
to O
cancel O
plans O
with O
me O
if O
they O
’re O
sick B-ADR
or O
might O
be O
sick B-ADR
. O


Yeah O
. O

Weekly O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
injectable O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
hydroxychloroquine B-DRUG
, O
and O
prednisone B-DRUG
. O

My O
last O
flare B-ADR
was O
hard O
to O
get O
under O
control O
. O


Methotrexate B-DRUG
with O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
been O
a O
miracle O
drug O
combo O
for O
me O
, O
fwiw O
. O

All O
psoriasis B-ADR
is O
gone O
and O
only O
occasional O
mild O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
in O
a O
couple O
of O
spots O
. O


Personally O
, O
I O
do O
n’t O
think O
so O
. O

But O
my O
RA O
is O
not O
being O
fully O
treated O
at O
present O
( O
waiting O
to O
start O
Humira B-DRUG
) O
. O


I O
’m O
currently O
19 O
weeks O
pregnant O
. O

I O
stayed O
on O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
am O
doing O
okay O
so O
far O
. O

I O
’ve O
had O
some O
rectal B-ADR
pressure I-ADR
issues O
but O
I O
think O
it O
’s O
just O
round O
ligament B-ADR
pain I-ADR
against O
scar B-ADR
tissue I-ADR
from O
past O
fistulas O
. O

I O
do O
have B-ADR
the I-ADR
runs I-ADR
daily O
but O
that O
’s O
normal O
for O
me O
haha O
. O


I O
'm O
sorry O
your O
dealing O
with O
that O
.. O
I O
get O
that O
too O
but O
just O
working O
on O
getting O
my O
AS O
diagnosis O
. O

Rheum O
said O
I O
had O
all O
the O
symptoms B-ADR
but O
no O
imaging O
and O
I O
am O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
twice O
a O
month O
. O



 O
I O
am O
curious O
what O
folks O
say O
because O
the O
spine O
doc O
I O
saw O
said O
if O
my O
SI O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
I O
have O
gets O
worse O
he O
'd O
recommend O
steroid B-DRUG
injection O
for O
that O
. O



 O
Eta O

🤦 O

♀ O
️ O

Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
sharing O
! O

Until O
recently O
I O
have O
n’t O
noticed O
any O
hair B-ADR
loss I-ADR
in O
the O
shower O
, O
but O
over O
the O
last O
6 O
months O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
a O
few O
strands O
will O
come O
out O
. O

( O
Glad O
to O
hear O
that O
yours O
grew O
back O
! O

) O
The O
scaly O
psoriasis B-ADR
sounds O
very O
much O
like O
what O
I O
have O
. O

What O
did O
you O
do O
to O
remedy O
it O
? O

Did O
you O
stay O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
do O
something O
else O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
psoriasis B-ADR
? O

Or O
did O
you O
switch O
from O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
? O


Psoriasis B-ADR
. O

It O
's O
all O
over O
my O
body O
and O
it O
sucks O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
'm O
poor O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
a O
medicine O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
fix O
it O
. O


Mine O
did O
that O
, O
got O
worse O
, O
showed O
the O
doc O
and O
he O
said O
“ O
your O
immune O
system O
really O
hates O
humira B-DRUG
” O
discontinued O
it O
immediately O
and O
switched O
to O
Simponi B-DRUG
. O

No O
side O
offers O
or O
site O
reactions O
at O
all O
. O


I O
have O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
almost O
3 O
years O
and O
have O
zero O
side O
effects O
. O

Talk O
to O
your O
Dr. O
  O
It O
probably O
should O
n't O
be O
that O
way O
. O


I O
do O
n’t O
know O
if O
I O
’m O
alone O
in O
this O
but O
my O
symptoms O
have O
actually O
been O
way O
reduced O
since O
getting O
Covid O
. O

I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
when O
Covid O
hit O
and O
I O
never O
started O
back O
up O
again O
. O

This O
was O
January O
, O
I O
still O
have O
random O
pains O
but O
it O
is O
a O
lot O
more O
mild O
than O
before O
Covid O
. O

Am O
I O
the O
only O
one O
? O


I O
'm O
on O
a O
higher O
dose O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
my O
current O
insurance O
refuses O
to O
cover O
it O
. O



 O
Have O
your O
G.I. O
send O
an O
appeal O
to O
the O
insurance O
company O
. O

Either O
they O
will O
see O
the O
medical O
necessity O
of O
you O
receiving O
it O
more O
frequently O
, O
or O
deny O
it O
again O
. O

If O
they O
deny O
it O
again O
, O
have O
your O
G.I. O
reach O
out O
to O
Janssen O
CarePath O
with O
the O
rejections O
so O
they O
can O
provide O
assistance O
. O

They O
offer O
co O
- O
pay O
assistance O
, O
and O
other O
programs O
that O
will O
help O
you O
get O
the O
medication O
without O
going O
through O
insurance O
. O


Sending O
positive O
vibes O
. O

I O
hope O
that O
it O
works O
for O
you O
. O

If O
it O
does O
n’t O
work O
, O
do O
n’t O
give O
up O
on O
the O
possibility O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
being O
covered O
by O
your O
insurance O
. O

It O
takes O
a O
determined O
and O
knowledgeable O
insurance O
person O
from O
your O
GI O
’s O
office O
to O
pursue O
this O
. O

Trust O
me O
on O
this O
as O
a O
retired O
Medical O
Office O
Manager O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
has O
improved O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
so O
much O
that O
I O
have O
n’t O
wanted O
to O
die O
at O
all O
since O
I O
started O
it O
. O

There O
’s O
hope O
with O
the O
right O
treatment O
. O


I O
think O
it O
has O
worked O
for O
me O
, O
but O
hard O
to O
say O
. O

I O
’m O
37 O
with O
A.S. O
Before O
humira B-DRUG
I O
was O
getting O
a O
flare B-ADR
that O
would O
last O
about O
a O
year O
then O
I O
would O
go O
2 O
- O
3 O
years O
flare O
free O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
2 O
years O
now O
and O
have O
felt O
minor O
flare B-ADR
ups I-ADR
but O
they O
usually O
last O
a O
few O
months O
and O
stay O
mild O
. O

Would O
it O
have O
been O
a O
major O
problem O
if O
it O
was O
n’t O
for O
the O
humira B-DRUG
? O

Maybe O
. O

I O
also O
have O
bouts O
of O
uveitis B-ADR
that O
seem O
more O
frequent O
with O
humira B-DRUG
. O

But O
I O
think O
it O
’s O
worth O
it O
for O
me O
. O

Dealing O
with O
insurance O
and O
abbivie O
and O
the O
doctors O
office O
sucks O
tho O
. O

Plan O
to O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
on O
hold O
and O
going O
back O
and O
fourth O
between O
the O
three O
when O
you O
first O
get O
it O
, O
when O
your O
copay O
assistance O
expires O
or O
is O
used O
up O
, O
and O
if O
you O
ever O
change O
insurance O
. O

Hoard O
pens O
when O
you O
can O
. O


I O
am O
currently O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
added O
Dapsone B-DRUG
last O
May O
. O

It O
has O
made O
the O
biggest O
change O
in O
my O
life O
. O

I O
've O
only O
had O
one O
new O
cyst B-ADR
in O
that O
time O
and O
my O
older O
sites O
are O
much O
, O
much O
better O
. O

Initially O
you O
have O
to O
do O
blood O
work O
every O
month O
for O
the O
first O
6 O
months O
. O

My O
red B-ADR
blood I-ADR
cells I-ADR
dropped I-ADR
slightly O
but O
have O
held O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
you O
talk O
to O
your O
physician O
about O
Dapsone B-DRUG
. O

My O
dermatologist O
also O
said O
he O
's O
had O
patients O
have O
major O
improvement O
using O
Humira B-DRUG
with O
spirolactone B-DRUG
. O

Just O
wanted O
to O
share O
. O

I O
know O
it O
's O
not O
specifically O
what O
you O
asked O
, O
but O
it O
might O
be O
worth O
looking O
into O
. O


First O
months O
of O
MTX B-DRUG
shots O
used O
to O
knock O
me O
down O
in O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
. O



 O
It O
's O
been O
I O
guess O
5h O
and O
I O
'm O
okay O
- O
ish O
. O

Fingers O
crossed O
but O
let O
's O
see O
how O
I O
wake O
up O
tomorrow O
. O

I O
've O
been O
in O
a O
flare B-ADR
cause O
the O
rheum O
wanted O
me O
to O
be O
off O
of O
humira B-DRUG
for O
4 O
weeks O
before O
starting O
cosentyx B-DRUG
, O
so O
my O
body O
is O
on O
a O
rampage O
against O
me O
. O



 O
I O
have O
a O
concert O
on O
01/27 O
so O
hopefully O
I O
'll O
be O
used O
to O
it O
by O
then O
. O


Thanks O
! O

Yeah O
, O
it O
's O
not O
fun O
. O

Over O
the O
summer O
I O
was O
feeling O
OK O
about O
everything O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
excited O
about O
taking O
medication O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
felt O
pretty O
good O
. O

Now O
the O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
is O
more O
regular O
again O
. O

Along O
with O
that O
is O
the O
background O
anxiety B-ADR
about O
damage B-ADR
, O
which O
is O
happening O
when O
you O
feel O
the O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O



 O
I O
'm O
pretty O
hopeful O
about O
the O
future O
, O
though O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
worked O
really O
well O
, O
at O
least O
before O
it O
started O
wearing O
off O
. O

If O
I O
can O
stay O
on O
a O
particular O
biologic O
longer O
, O
I O
should O
be O
mostly O
OK O
. O

Also O
hoping O
for O
breakthroughs O
down O
the O
road O
. O


It O
’s O
happening O
to O
me O
. O

But O
I O
also O
have O
avascular B-ADR
necrosis I-ADR
of O
the O
hips O
. O

Well O
… O
until O
I O
had O
them O
replaced O
at O
30 O
and O
31 O
. O

Now O
I O
hope O
and O
click O
, O
pop O
, O
of O
crackle O
is O
just O
PsA. O
Fingers O
crossed O
just O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

My O
PsA O
is O
mainly O
in O
the O
hands O
but O
I O
suspect O
the O
knees O
and O
shoulders O
are O
more O
AVN O

I O
had O
some O
trouble O
with O
the O
specialty O
pharmacy O
and O
my O
new O
insurance O
miscommunicating O
but O
one O
phone O
call O
with O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
rep O
at O
Abbvie O
fixed O
it O
. O

She O
was O
amazing O
and O
got O
both O
parties O
on O
a O
conference O
call O
and O
handled O
it O
while O
I O
was O
on O
hold O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
have O
a O
smooth O
transition O
! O


Humira B-DRUG
’s O
patent O
expired O
. O

Generic O
is O
literally O
the O
exact O
same O
thing O
. O

It O
’s O
going O
to O
be O
just O
fine O
, O
I O
promise O

Good O
luck O
with O
the O
stelara B-DRUG
! O

I O
've O
been O
on O
it O
for O
almost O
five O
years O
, O
I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
several O
years O
before O
that O
. O

If O
it O
helps O
you O
feel O
better O
any O
, O
between O
the O
two O
I O
much O
prefer O
stelara B-DRUG
. O

It O
took O
some O
time O
for O
me O
to O
get O
used O
to O
it O
, O
but O
after O
I O
did O
it O
has O
been O
working O
really O
well O
. O


I O
saw O
your O
original O
post O
and O
given O
the O
severity O
, O
I O
’d O
ask O
myself O
what O
the O
potential O
consequences O
of O
not O
going O
on O
humira B-DRUG
could O
be O
for O
you O
. O

Your O
doc O
has O
weighed O
the O
potential O
risk O
and O
benefit O
of O
this O
medication O
before O
prescribing O
it O
to O
you O
. O

Are O
you O
using O
the O
abbvie O
care O
program O
? O

The O
nurses O
should O
be O
able O
to O
go O
through O
your O
concerns O
in O
detail O
and O
address O
them O
. O




 O
I O
was O
really O
worried O
about O
side O
effects O
with O
humira B-DRUG
and O
put O
it O
off O
for O
about O
four O
years O
before O
I O
finally O
started O
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
pleasantly O
surprised O
overall O
. O



 O
Letting O
the O
injection O
get O
to O
room O
temperature O
( O
3ish O
hours O
) O
helps O
substantially O
with O
the O
burning O
. O

I O
get O
a O
small O
site O
reaction B-ADR
24 O
hours O
after O
injection O
that O
’s O
itchy B-ADR
and O
annoying O
but O
goes O
away O
on O
its O
own O
. O

I O
’ve O
got O
a O
lot O
going O
on O
health O
wise O
so O
it O
’s O
always O
hard O
to O
tell O
if O
anything O
is O
specifically O
because O
of O
humira B-DRUG
but O
I O
have O
n’t O
had O
any O
noticeable O
side O
effects O
and O
it O
’s O
helped O
a O
lot O
with O
my O
HS O
. O



 O
Best O
of O
luck O

) O


 O
I O
tried O
taking O
turmeric B-DRUG
but O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
like O
I O
had O
acid B-ADR
reflux I-ADR
all O
day O
so O
I O
stopped O
that O
one O

Why O
do O
they O
still O
use O
the O
citrate O
ones O
? O

I O
’m O
from O
the O
UK O
so O
we O
use O
Amgevita B-DRUG
anyway O
which O
is O
just O
a O
cheaper O
brand O
but O
I O
’m O
pretty O
sure O
it O
is O
citrate O
free O
and O
much O
cheaper O
than O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
so O
why O
do O
you O
still O
get O
Humira B-DRUG
that O
is O
n’t O
citrate O
free O
? O

I O
know O
it O
was O
added O
as O
a O
preservative O
but O
was O
n’t O
it O
found O
to O
be O
completely O
unnecessary O
? O


Do O
you O
have O
side O
effects O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
? O

I O
've O
been O
on O
Simponi B-DRUG
for O
4 O
months O
now O
and O
it O
's O
giving O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
psoriasis B-ADR
. O

And O
probably O
insomnia B-ADR
and O
depression B-ADR
. O


Yeah O
haha O
your O
story O
sounded O
so O
eerily O
familiar O
I O
had O
to O
ask O
! O

I O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
issues O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
before O
the O
psoriasis B-ADR
, O
but O
if O
your O
skin B-ADR
issues I-ADR
roughly O
coincided O
with O
the O
eye O
& O
sinus B-ADR
problems I-ADR
, O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
makes O
sense O
to O
consider O
whether O
they O
might O
be O
related O
maybe O
? O

I O
know O
eye B-ADR
inflammation I-ADR
sometimes O
occurs O
with O
crohns O
too O
, O
so O
it O
's O
so O
hard O
to O
know O
what O
could O
be O
drug B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
vs. O
autoimmune B-ADR
issue I-ADR
vs. O
pregnancy O
- O
related O
or O
other O
cause O
! O

Definitely O
scary O
to O
consider O
that O
a O
medication O
that O
works O
super O
well O
might O
be O
causing O
issues O
:/ O
Hopefully O
you O
have O
a O
pretty O
good O
doctor O
to O
talk O
things O
through O
with O
! O

! O


Mine O
ordered O
an O
ultrasound O
for O
my O
liver O
to O
check O
for O
fatty B-ADR
liver I-ADR
after O
my O
" O
Liver O
Enzymes O
were O
slightly O
elevated O
" O
3 O
months O
in O
a O
row O
. O

  O
I O
am O
pleased O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
overall O
, O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
keep O
gaining O
9 O
- O
10 O
pounds O
per O
month O
. O


Same O
thing O
just O
happened O
to O
me O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
failed O
and O
dr O
put O
me O
on O
coseyntx B-DRUG
. O

One O
is O
a O
tnf O
inhibitor O
and O
the O
other O
works O
on O
the O
interleukin-17A. O
Tnf O
inhibitors O
work O
way O
better O
for O
me O
. O

I O
got O
much O
worse O
on O
coseyntx B-DRUG
and O
just O
this O
Wednesday O
started O
another O
tnf O
inhibitor- O
simponi B-DRUG
aria I-DRUG
infusion- O
this O
is O
full O
human O
dna O
so O
my O
likelihood O
of O
building O
a O
resistance O
to O
it O
is O
lower O
. O

I O
was O
out O
of O
pain B-ADR
after O
24 O
hours O
after O
infusion O
. O

  O
Tnf O
works O
more O
on O
inflammation B-ADR
response- O
coseyntx B-DRUG
works O
more O
on O
the O
skin B-ADR
thickening I-ADR
it O
seems O
. O

If O
they O
could O
combine O
both O
, O
that O
would O
be O
perfect O
imo O
. O


Re O
: O
your O
last O
point O
, O
I O
believe O
this O
is O
a O
“ O
copay O
maximizer O
” O
program O
? O

Just O
the O
latest O
scheme O
to O
extract O
the O
maximum O
possible O
profit O
from O
their O
human O
capital O
( O
us O
) O
. O



 O
I O
am O
in O
the O
same O
boat O
for O
the O
first O
time O
this O
year O
. O

So O
furious O
they O
are O
exploiting O
this O
ACA O
loophole O
by O
relabeling O
Humira B-DRUG
as O
a O
“ O
non O
essential O
drug O
” O
like O
I O
’m O
getting O
lip O
fillers O
or O
something O
. O

They O
charge O
me O
so O
much O
now O
that O
my O
copay O
assistance O
will O
run O
out O
in O
a O
few O
more O
months O
. O

Then O
I O
dunno O
what O
I O
’ll O
do O
. O


I O
’ll O
get O
back O
to O
you O
in O
several O
months O
, O
lol O
. O

I O
am O
9w4d O
today O
. O

It O
did O
take O
us O
2 O
years O
to O
get O
pregnant O
and O
we O
had O
to O
have O
an O
IUI O
to O
achieve O
this O
pregnancy O
. O

So O
far O
, O
I O
’m O
feeling O
pretty O
good O
. O

My O
joints O
are O
feeling O
pretty O
good O
. O

I O
am O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
prednisone B-DRUG
. O

I O
am O
hoping O
I O
continue O
to O
feel O
better O
! O


Yeah O
I O
've O
had O
symptoms O
my O
whole O
life O
. O

Mum O
dragged O
me O
to O
doctors O
all O
the O
time O
. O

I O
got O
diagnosed O
with O
.. O
not O
peeing O
enough O
at O
school O
. O

Yep O
. O

As O
a O
child O
I O
was O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
constipation B-ADR
etc O
. O

My O
parents O
went O
into O
mode O
of O
cooking O
everything O
from O
scratch O
and O
organic O
. O

Then O
we O
moved O
countries O
, O
and O
as O
a O
teen O
it O
kinda O
quietened O
down O
.. O
until O
I O
had O
to O
have O
surgery O
for O
anal B-ADR
fistula I-ADR
at O
20(whole O
ordeal O
did O
last O
a O
year O
though O
) O
, O
to O
be O
told O
nope O
not O
Chrons O
. O

At O
22 O
, O
I O
was O
in O
immense O
pain B-ADR
, O
could O
n't O
walk O
more O
than O
like O
50 O
m O
etc O
, O
got O
sent O
into O
hospital O
as O
GP O
thought O
it O
was O
appendicitis B-ADR
then O
after O
that O
fiasco O
, O
got O
a O
call O
from O
that O
hospital O
to O
see O
a O
specialist O
, O
I O
did O
. O

By O
that O
point O
I O
was O
also O
luckily O
employed O
with O
private O
health O
insurance O
in O
UK O
, O
so O
a O
colleague O
literally O
told O
me O
to O
drop O
all O
I O
'm O
doing O
and O
sort O
it O
using O
that O
. O

I O
did O
and O
was O
so O
thankful O
as O
my O
diagnosis O
took O
a O
month O
, O
and O
was O
given O
steroids O
straight O
away O
. O

Got O
diagnosed O
with O
Chrons O
on O
Halloween O
2017 O
. O

Started O
Humira B-DRUG
June O
2018 O
. O


The O
only O
thing O
I O
've O
noticed O
negative O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
that O
cuts O
and O
bruises B-ADR
seem O
to O
take O
longer O
to O
heal O
. O

I O
started O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
a O
little O
over O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
its O
a O
GAME O
CHANGER O
. O

So O
do O
it O
. O

ASAP O
. O



 O
I O
also O
travel O
for O
work O
and O
have O
n't O
even O
gotten O
so O
much O
as O
a O
case O
of O
the O
sniffles O
. O

Mask O
up O
, O
wash O
your O
hands O
, O
and O
enjoy O
a O
much O
better O
quality O
of O
life O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


I O
would O
start O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
or O
other O
biologic O
. O

Should O
get O
PSA O
all O
but O
gone O
and O
allow O
you O
to O
focus O
on O
EDS B-ADR
. O

The O
aneurysm B-ADR
type O
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
as O
that O
could O
become O
a O
serious O
issue O
in O
little O
time O
. O

Hopefully O
you O
do O
n’t O
smoke O
or O
drink O
alcohol O
in O
any O
serious O
amounts O
. O


yeah O
, O
i O
got O
a O
scary O
letter O
recently O
saying O
they O
do O
n't O
believe O
i O
need O
humira B-DRUG
at O
my O
currently O
dosage O
( O

... O
I O
also O
break B-ADR
out I-ADR

I O
grow O

I O
took O
my O
first O

2 O

I O
had O
minor O
stomach O

the O

day O
but O
nothing O
besides O
that O
. O

Switched O
from O
Humira B-DRUG

did O
n’t O
do O
much O
for O

I O
have O
n’t O
noticed O
a O
huge O
difference O
yet O
in O
my O
daily O
pain B-ADR
but O
no O
major O
flares B-ADR
from O
either O
. O


It O
is O
a O
TNF O
inhibitor O
that O
is O
made O
from O
full O
human O

makes O
it O
less O

your O

Humira B-DRUG

. O

I O
take O
pregabalin B-DRUG
for O
fibro O
and O
Humira+mtx B-DRUG
for O
PsA. O
The O
treatment O
for O
each O
condition O
is O
different O
and O
you O
’ll O
notice O
that O
each O
kind O
of O
pain B-ADR
improves O
with O
appropriate O
treatment O
. O

In O
general O
fibro O
is O
noticed O
as O
aches B-ADR
and O
soreness B-ADR
in O
areas O
with O
no O
apparent O
injury B-ADR
. O

Generally O
this O
pain B-ADR
comes O
on O
and O
goes O
or O
moves O
. O

It O
’s O
also O
associated O
with O
a O
wild O
list O
of O
other O
symptoms O
including O
brain B-ADR
fog I-ADR
and O
has O
overlaps O
with O
IBS B-ADR
and O
bladder B-ADR
problems I-ADR
. O

PsA O
is O
felt O
in O
the O
joints O
as O
an O
arthritic B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
and O
can O
also O
cause O
hot O
and O
swelling B-ADR
joints O
. O


I O
've O
had O
injections O
, O
and O
I O
highly O
recommend O
them O
for O
certain O
sores B-ADR
like O
the O
one O
you O
describe O
. O

  O
It O
can O
definitely O
be O
painful O
, O
but O
not O
overly O
so O
, O
and O
the O
injection O
part O
lasts O
maybe O
15ish O
seconds O
on O
a O
bump O
. O

  O
I O
think O
this O
is O
partly O
because O
the O
derm O
doing O
my O
injections O
does O
n't O
go O
directly O
in O
from O
the O
top O
through O
the O
most O
sensitive O
area O
, O
it O
goes O
in O
from O
the O
sides O
2 O
- O
3 O
times O
, O
so O
it O
really O
is O
n't O
that O
different O
from O
getting O
a O
needle O
stick O
in O
you O
in O
a O
random O
non O
- O
sensitive O
area O
. O

  O
In O
fact O
, O
it O
felt O
about O
the O
same O
as O
getting O
the O
local O
injected O
before O
surgery O
. O



 O
The O
next O
day O
I O
'd O
usually O
see O
a O
massive O
decrease O
in O
inflammation B-ADR
and O
pain B-ADR
, O
and O
this O
lasts O
for O
2 O
- O
3 O
weeks O
. O

  O
If O
the O
flare B-ADR
was O
a O
temporary O
one O
that O
would O
've O
died O
down O
eventually O
, O
it O
tends O
to O
be O
gone O
for O
a O
while O
and O
you O
get O
to O
skip O
the O
whole O
bursting B-ADR
and O
open B-ADR
wound I-ADR
phase O
. O

  O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if O
the O
sore B-ADR
happens O
to O
be O
one O
that O
was O
just O
constantly O
draining O
for O
over O
a O
year O
, O
it O
'll O
start O
ramping O
up O
again O
during O
week O
3 O
and O
back B-ADR
to O
normal O
for O
the O
4th O
week O
, O
then O
the O
dermatologist O
can O
inject O
it O
again O
since O
a O
month O
has O
passed O
. O

  O
Even O
that O
was O
worth O
it O
, O
but O
not O
really O
sufficient O
, O
which O
is O
why O
I O
went O
for O
surgical O
options O
, O
and O
then O
eventually O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


If O
u O
have O
a O
history O
of O
allergy B-ADR
’s O
can O
cause O
this O
, O
and O
with O
that O
history O
it O
’s O
recommend O
ur O
not O
on O
humira B-DRUG
anyways O
. O

They O
took O
me O
off O
due O
to O
severe O
food B-ADR
allergy I-ADR
’s O
and O
environmental O
allergy B-ADR
’s O

I O
used O
to O
know O
this O
but O
have O
forgotten O
. O

  O
They O
have O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
time O
where O
you O
are O
ok O
going O
past O
your O
shot O
day O
. O



 O
If O
you O
go O
too O
long O
you O
have O
to O
do O
the O
loading O
doses O
again O
. O



 O
You O
can O
call O
humira B-DRUG
up O
and O
ask O
for O
a O
nurse O
. O

  O
That O
is O
who O
told O
me O
. O


My O
gf O
has O
chrones O
, O
Humira B-DRUG
injections O
are O
the O
cure O
, O
NO O
MORE O
FLARE B-ADR
UPS I-ADR
. O

Ask O
your O
doctor O
about O
it O

How O
long O
you O
are O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
? O

I O
got O
my O
pens O
today O
. O


Since O
no O
one O
has O
mentioned O
it O
: O
EEN O
. O

It O
is O
the O
only O
“ O
diet O
” O
( O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
) O
that O
has O
been O
shown O
in O
RCTs O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
or O
more O
effective O
than O
prednisone B-DRUG
to O
achieve O
remission B-ADR
. O



 O
If O
that O
works O
for O
you O
slowly O
transition O
to O
a O
diet O
that O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be O
more O
effective O
than O
SAD O
in O
an O
actual O
trial O
( O
even O
though O
all O
trials O
I O
’ve O
seen O
are O
of O
fairly O
low O
quality O
) O
. O

Examples O
: O
ibd B-ADR
aid O
, O
Mediterranean O
, O
SCD O
, O
CED O
are O
the O
most O
popular O
. O



 O
I O
am O
a O
big O
believer O
in O
using O
diet O
and O
lifestyle O
to O
help O
treat O
my O
crohns O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n’t O
just O
mean O
helping O
symptoms O
, O
I O
mean O
actually O
treating O
the O
inflammation B-ADR
. O



 O
But O
importantly O
, O
even O
bigger O
believer O
in O
medicine O
, O
because O
it O
has O
much O
more O
evidence O
to O
show O
it O
effectiveness O
. O



 O
I O
know O
it O
’s O
frustrating O
to O
try O
a O
bunch O
of O
medication O
and O
nothing O
works O
. O

But O
please O
keep O
trying O
, O
the O
great O
thing O
about O
using O
diet O
to O
treat O
crohns O
is O
that O
you O
can O
do O
that O
as O
combination O
therapy O
. O

And O
if O
you O
choose O
one O
of O
the O
4 O
diets O
I O
suggested O
, O
or O
a O
combination O
of O
them O
, O
and O
it O
does O
n’t O
work O
for O
you O
: O
atleast O
you O
’ve O
switched O
to O
a O
healthier O
diet O
and O
will O
improve O
your O
overall O
health O
. O

( O
If O
you O
’re O
on O
SAD O
now O
) O
. O



 O
Personally O
I O
’m O
on O
entyvio B-DRUG
and O
azathioprine B-DRUG
after O
failing O
Humira B-DRUG
( O
and O
others O
) O
. O

But O
I O
used O
EEN O
to O
get O
into O
remission O
and O
I O
still O
eat O
what O
I O
think O
is O
optimizing O
my O
gut O
health O
( O
but O
I O
’m O
not O
sure O
it O
does O
much O
, O
but O
like O
I O
said O
, O
if O
it O
does O
nothing O
, O
atleast O
I O
’m O
eating O
healthy O
) O
. O



 O
Tl;dr O
: O
keep O
trying O
meds O
, O
do O
try O
EEN O
and O
potentially O
ibd B-ADR
aid O
, O
SCD O
, O
Mediterranean O
or O
CED O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
was O
my O
first O
biologic O
. O

It O
started O
out O
pretty O
effective O
, O
but O
I O
was O
getting O
diminishing O
returns O
with O
each O
shot O
and O
it O
was O
n't O
doing O
much O
for O
my O
foot B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

Only O
got O
3 O
months O
out O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


Not O
UC O
but O
yes O
. O

Mine O
flares B-ADR
just O
like O
my O
AS O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
and O
Sulfasalazine B-DRUG
make O
me O
feel O
SO O
much O
better O
but O
if O
I O
miss O
a O
SS O
dose O
my O
gut O
knows O
! O


I O
'm O
almost O
positive O
that O
Humira B-DRUG
( O
name O
brand O
, O
not O
generic O
/ O
biosimilar O
) O
is O
available O
in O
Mexico O
. O


I O
have O
n’t O
heard O
of O
this O
medication O
before O
. O


Recently O
, O
I O
became O
resistant O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
went O
on O
stellara O
. O

Not O
once O
have O
I O
even O
heard O
of O
this O
medication O
. O


I O
’m O
going O
to O
assume O
that O
you O
’re O
put O
on O
that O
medication O
due O
to O
becoming O
resistant O
to O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
imuran B-DRUG
. O

That O
is O
if O
this O
medication O
is O
an O
immune O
suppressant O
, O
and O
is O
being O
used O
as O
an O
immuno O
suppressant O
. O



 O
When O
looking O
it O
up O
, O
it O
’s O
used O
to O
treat O
different O
kinds O
of O
Leukemia B-ADR
. O

Something O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
. O


I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
now O
on O
Embrel B-DRUG
. O

I O
have O
no O
problems O
with O
interactions O
and O
actually O
feel O
better O
with O
cannabis B-DRUG
than O
without O
. O

RA O
is O
an O
approved O
disease O
that O
benefits O
with O
cannabis B-DRUG
used O
medically O
. O

Dosage O
information O
is O
n’t O
available O
for O
anyone O
sadly O
. O

That O
needs O
to O
be O
addressed O
. O

For O
now O
we O
just O
do O
enough O
to O
feel O
better O
and O
have O
no O
consequences O
physically O
. O

Hopefully O
the O
federal O
government O
will O
change O
those O
states O
who O
still O
have O
antiquated O
laws O
. O

I O
hate O
visiting O
my O
family O
and O
leaving O
important O
parts O
of O
my O
medicine O
behind O
. O

It O
’s O
ridiculous O
. O

Not O
only O
affects O
my O
pain B-ADR
, O
but O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
and O
depression B-ADR
as O
well O
. O


I O
agree O
, O
fifty O
days O
is O
not O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Especially O
since O
Humira B-DRUG
stays O
in O
your O
system O
for O
about O
110 O
days O
. O

Almost O
half O
way O
there O
and O
will O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

Yes O
, O
my O
Doctor O
knows O
. O


It O
took O
about O
a O
year O
on O
remicaide B-DRUG
for O
me O
to O
start O
feeling O
somewhat O
normal O
. O

I O
tried O
humira B-DRUG
but O
quickly O
developed O
antibodies O
so O
I O
was O
only O
on O
it O
for O
about O
5 O
months O
before O
switching O
. O


I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
weekly O
for O
about O
3 O
years O
and O
was O
happy O
with O
it O
, O
no O
side O
effects O
. O

Came O
off O
it O
for O
an O
operation O
and O
it O
never O
quite O
worked O
the O
same O
again O
. O

Saying O
that O
with O
the O
2 O
weeks O
apart O
I O
felt O
the O
improvement O
and O
then O
the O
drop O
before O
the O
next O
one O
so O
It O
was O
easy O
to O
make O
the O
decision O
to O
take O
it O
more O
often O
. O


Same O
here O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
made O
my O
lungs O
swell B-ADR
and O
caused O
a O
host O
of O
other O
serious O
problems O
. O

Antibody O
levels O
were O
in O
the O
thousands O
. O

Switched O
to O
stelara B-DRUG
. O

It O
obviously O
was O
n't O
working O
at O
all O
until O
I O
started O
taking O
it O
every O
6 O
weeks O
instead O
of O
8 O
. O

Now O
I O
'm O
doing O
much O
better O
but O
ever O
since O
I O
started O
stelara B-DRUG
, O
I O
've O
had O
nonstop O
headaches B-ADR
and O
migraines B-ADR
and O
get O
skin O
and O
yeast B-ADR
infections I-ADR
like O
crazy O
. O

Going O
to O
give O
the O
6 O
weeks O
frequency O
a O
chance O
since O
now O
my O
bowel O
movements O
are O
finally O
getting O
normal O
and O
healthy O
again O
( O
but O
I O
am O
still O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
, O
so O
ill O
wait O
to O
come O
off O
of O
that O
again O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
this O
time O
. O

) O

Do O
n't O
lose O
hope O
just O
yet O
, O
can O
definitely O
take O
longer O
than O
2 O
months O
. O

I O
've O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
close O
to O
6 O
or O
7 O
years O
now O
and O
have O
restarted O
it O
once O
in O
that O
time O
frame O
recently O
. O

Took O
3 O
- O
4 O
months O
for O
~80 O
- O
90 O
% O
clear O
up O
of O
skin O
psoriasis B-ADR
. O

For O
me O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
many O
others O
, O
there O
is O
no O
100 O
% O
effective O
biologic O
and O
you O
will O
always O
have O
some O
small O
patches O
. O

My O
dermatologist O
prescribed O
Bryhali B-DRUG
for O
stubborn O
patches O
to O
use O
while O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
itchiness B-ADR
and O
dry B-ADR
skin I-ADR
in O
my O
experience O
was O
the O
first O
to O
go O
, O
then O
the O
patches O
slowly O
went O
away O
. O

Two O
more O
shots O
before O
2 O
month O
timeframe O
is O
actually O
a O
lot O
to O
go O
, O
you O
have O
time O
. O

Hang O
in O
there O
. O


How O
are O
you O
now O
? O

Still O
in O
HUMIRA B-DRUG
? O


I O
had O
inverse O
psoriasis B-ADR
on O
stelara B-DRUG
, O
but O
  O
my O
inverse O
psoriasis B-ADR
flares B-ADR
real O
bad O
whenever O
I O
am O
on O
any O
crohns O
meds O
( O
like O
humira B-DRUG
, O
remicade B-DRUG
, O
and O
now O
entyvio B-DRUG
) O
. O

When O
I O
go O
off O
meds O
the O
rash B-ADR
goes O
away O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
/ O
adalimumab O
has O
not O
worked O
well O
for O
me O
either O
. O



 O
I O
was O
originally O
on O
Taltz B-DRUG
for O
my O
psoriasis B-ADR
which O
worked O
GREAT O
. O

At O
least O
98 O
% O
clearance O
( O
my O
Dr O
said O
I O
still O
had O
some O
patches O
on O
my O
scalp O
but O
I O
could O
n’t O
feel O
them O
) O
. O

Then O
I O
got O
the O
COVID O
vaccine O
and O
my O
joints O
began O
acting O
up O
, O
along O
with O
some O
enthesitis B-ADR
, O
so O
I O
went O
to O
a O
rheumatologist O
who O
decided O
to O
switch O
me O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O



 O
To O
its O
credit O
it O
has O
improved O
my O
enthesitis B-ADR
and O
my O
smaller O
joints O
— O
like O
my O
hands O
. O

But O
my O
ankle O
still O
swells B-ADR
up O
if O
I O
’m O
very O
active O
, O
and O
I O
ca O
n’t O
take O
a O
long O
walk O
down O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
street O
or O
my O
back O
is O
on O
fire O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
my O
actual O
psoriasis B-ADR
has O
come O
back O
— O
although O
not O
as O
bad O
as O
it O
was O
before O
Taltz B-DRUG
. O



 O
I O
went O
to O
my O
dermatologist O
and O
asked O
to O
be O
prescribed O
Otezla B-DRUG
/ O
apremilast B-DRUG
, O
since O
it O
can O
be O
safely O
taken O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
just O
started O
taking O
that O
this O
weekend O
, O
hopefully O
I O
can O
see O
some O
improvement O
. O

If O
not O
my O
dermatologist O
suggested O
I O
talk O
to O
my O
rheumatologist O
about O
possible O
infusions O
, O
since O
he O
ca O
n’t O
do O
them O
in O
his O
office O
. O


You O
described O
almost O
all O
of O
my O
symptoms O
when O
it O
's O
almost O
time O
for O
my O
next O
humira B-DRUG
shot O
. O

  O
I O
've O
only O
used O
humira B-DRUG
so O
far O
. O

  O
I O
hope O
you O
can O
get O
some O
relief O

Yeah O
, O
I O
had O
to O
take O
prednisone B-DRUG
again O
for O
a O
recent O
flare B-ADR
up I-ADR
, O
fortunately O
it O
was O
only O
for O
5 O
days O
. O

I O
've O
never O
heard O
of O
humira B-DRUG
, O
what O
does O
that O
treat O
? O

I O
have O
rheumatoid B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR

I O
ve O
been O
taking O
azathioprine B-DRUG
and O
adalimumab B-DRUG
for O
6 O
weeks O
so O
far O
no O
unpleasant O
side O
effects O
other O
than O
some O
fatigue B-ADR

Humira B-DRUG
patent O
expires O
in O
July O
2023 O
, O
this O
may O
be O
a O
photo O
finish O
, O
if O
they O
get O
the O
extension O
! O


I O
have O
failed O
2 O
biologics O
so O
far O
. O

Entyvio B-DRUG
( O
developed O
a O
reaction B-ADR
) O
and O
then O
Remicade B-DRUG
( O
developed B-ADR
antibodies I-ADR
) O
. O

I O
'm O
now O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
but O
it O
's O
only O
been O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
so O
trying O
to O
wait O
it O
out O
. O


I O
hate O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
! O

I O
took O
it O
for O
years O
because O
it O
was O
the O
only O
option O
offered O
to O
me O
. O

I O
lasted O
a O
few O
weeks O
on O
oral O
and O
then O
went O
to O
injections O
. O



 O
The O
injections O
made O
me O
horribly O
nauseous B-ADR
and O
I O
threw O
up O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
after O
my O
injection O
. O

I O
caught O
all O
the O
flus O
and O
colds O
circulating O
and O
just O
felt O
generally O
like O
crap O
. O

Did O
n’t O
help O
much O
either O
. O



 O
Finally O
was O
approved O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
it O
worked O
very O
well O
and O
I O
was O
on O
it O
for O
15 O
years O
. O

Switched O
to O
Taltz B-DRUG
last O
October O
because O
it O
stopped B-ADR
helping I-ADR
my O
skin O
and O
I O
was O
covered O
in O
psoriasis B-ADR
from O
head O
to O
toe O
. O

I O
find O
biologic O
medication O
to O
be O
a O
lot O
more O
effective O
with O
a O
lot O
less O
miserable O
side O
effects O
. O


Hello O
! O

 

 O
I O
am O
a O
16F O
and O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
Crohn O
's O
2 O
months O
ago O
! O

I O
just O
want O
to O
start O
off O
by O
saying O
I O
'm O
so O
sorry O
you O
are O
going O
through O
this O
! O

the O
diagnosis O
time O
can O
be O
scary O
. O

Before O
getting O
diagnosed O
, O
I O
had O
stomach B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
diarrhea B-ADR
, O
achy B-ADR
joints I-ADR
, O
fevers B-ADR
, O
vomiting B-ADR
, O
fatigue B-ADR
... O
the O
list O
goes O
on O
! O

I O
had O
an O
endoscopy O
and O
colonoscopy O
and O
had O
ulcers B-ADR
in O
my O
stomach O
/ O
intestines O
as O
well O
. O



 O
I O
know O
the O
colonoscopy O
can O
be O
really O
scary O
- O
the O
idea O
of O
it O
really O
overwhelmed O
me O
at O
first O
. O

But O
, O
you O
will O
get O
through O
it O
! O

The O
hardest O
part O
was O
the O
prep O
and O
not O
eating O
for O
a O
day O
, O
the O
actual O
colonoscopy O
is O
chill O
- O
it O
's O
over O
before O
you O
even O
realize O
it O
! O

I O
was O
put O
under O
for O
mine O
and O
I O
barely O
remember O
it O
. O



 O
If O
you O
do O
end O
up O
getting O
diagnosed O
with O
Crohn O
's O
, O
I O
promise O
everything O
will O
be O
ok O
. O

In O
the O
moment O
it O
feels O
like O
your O
life O
has O
been O
turned O
upside O
down O
. O

I O
promise O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
! O

Just O
after O
one O
month O
of O
starting O
treatment O
( O
I O
'm O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
) O
I O
'm O
back O
to O
living O
my O
fully O
healthy O
life O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
have O
more O
Dr O
appointments O
than O
the O
average O
person O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
doing O
great O
and O
am O
having O
a O
fun O
senior O
year O
of O
high O
school O
! O



 O
If O
it O
is O
Crohn O
's O
, O
we O
are O
all O
here O
to O
support O
you O
and O
just O
know O
that O
you O
will O
get O
into O

and O
feel O
better O
! O



 O
I O
wish O
you O
the O
best O
in O
figuring O
out O
what O
's O
going O
on O
❤ O
️ O

I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
a O
while O
but O
it O
did O
n’t O
help O
and O
made O
my O
immune O
system O
trash O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
a O
drug O
called O
Soriatane B-DRUG
for O
a O
few O
months O
and O
it O
’s O
like O
night O
and O
day O
. O

Ask O
your O
doctor O
about O
that O
or O
a O
biologic O

They O
were O
! O

> O
_ O
< O
the O
humira B-DRUG
has O
only O
eased O
the O
flares B-ADR
and O
pain B-ADR
just O
a O
little O
bit O
but O
I O
still O
have O
those O
days O
where O
it O
’s O
just O
really O
unbearable O
. O


Agreed O
. O

It O
actually O
takes O
between O
50 O
to O
100 O
days O
  O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
completely O
leave O
your O
body O
. O

So O
that O
’s O
something O
to O
take O
into O
account O
. O

Interested O

see O
where O

on O
both O
humira B-DRUG

remicade B-DRUG

I O
had O
a O
relatively O
fast O
positive O
response O

humira B-DRUG

Entyvio B-DRUG

for O

I O
'm O
doing O
good O
on O
Stelara B-DRUG
, O
but O
the O
disease O
is O
still O
moderately O
active O
. O

Both O
remicade B-DRUG

Stelara B-DRUG
took O
a O
number O
of O
months O

I O

on O
150 O
mg O
of O
azathioprine B-DRUG
( O
was O
on O
250 O
mg O
until O
I O
started O
adalimumab B-DRUG
around O
4 O
months O
ago O
) O
. O



 O
I O
caught O
covid O
three O
weeks O
ago O
. O

I O
have O
had O
3 O
primary O
doses O
of O
vaccine O
and O
a O
booster O
( O
last O
dose O
in O
February O
- O
I O
was O
due O
my O
second O
booster O
the O
day O
after O
I O
tested O
positive O
, O
this O
has O
now O
been O
pushed O
back O
by O
6 O
weeks O
) O
. O



 O
I O
felt O
unwell B-ADR
on O
the O
Sunday O
, O
but O
figured O
I O
was O
eun O
down O
as O
I O
'd O
been O
to O
a O
big O
singing O
competition O
( O
wonder O
where O
I O
picked O
up O
the O
infection B-ADR
? O

) O
, O
so O
went O
to O
bed O
early O
. O

I O
woke O
up O
around O
1 O
am O
with O
a O
fever B-ADR
( O
38.1 O
° O
C O
) O
. O

I O
had O
a O
sore B-ADR
throat I-ADR
and O
blocked O
nose O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
sleep O
well O
due O
to O
the O
general O
flu B-ADR
- I-ADR
like I-ADR
symptoms I-ADR
. O

I O
still O
tested O
negative O
that O
next O
morning O
( O
Monday O
) O
, O
but O
tested O
positive O
on O
the O
afternoon O
. O

I O
called O
my O
IBD B-ADR
team O
and O
they O
arranged O
for O
me O
to O
start O
on O
antivirals O
( O
Paxlovid B-DRUG
, O
a O
combination O
of O
nirmatrelvir B-DRUG
and O
ritonavir B-DRUG
) O
on O
the O
Tuesday O
. O

The O
antivirals O
stopped O
the O
virus O
as O
it O
was O
basically O
- O
I O
still O
felt O
unwell B-ADR
but O
did O
n't O
get O
any O
worse O
. O

My O
fever B-ADR
broke O
after O
36hrs O
and O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
symptoms O
resolved O
themselves O
within O
10 O
days O
. O

I O
'm O
still O
easily O
breathless O
and O
the O
fatigue B-ADR
is O
bad O
( O
but O
is O
that O
the O
covid O
, O
or O
Crohn O
's O
, O
or O
aza O
, O
or O
adalimumab O
... O
) O
but O
otherwise O
recovered O
. O



 O
So O
all O
in O
all O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
vaccination O
and O
antivirals O
it O
was O
almost O
like O
a O
mild O
flu O
, O
with O
some O
lingering O
symptoms O
( O
but O
I O
'm O
only O
3 O
weeks O
out O
) O
that O
are O
n't O
great O
but O
are O
n't O
horrendous O
. O


Enbrel B-DRUG
was O
my O
first O
brand O
I O
used O
. O

It O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
for O
me O
around O
two O
years O
into O
it O
. O

My O
doctor O
switched O
me O
to O
humira B-DRUG
and O
I O
was O
on O
it O
for O
many O
years O
but O
just O
like O
enbrel B-DRUG
it O
hit O
a O
point O
where O
it O
just O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
. O

Humira B-DRUG
was O
really O
good O
in O
the O
beginning O
with O
little O
side O
effects O
. O

Headaches B-ADR
mostly O
. O

And O
now O
I O
was O
switched O
again O
to O
Taltz B-DRUG
. O

And O
it O
has O
been O
a O
life O
saver O
. O

First O
Taltz B-DRUG
injection O
made O
my O
joints O
feel O
great O
within O
a O
few O
hours O
. O

Only O
side O
effect O
I O
had O
with O
Taltz B-DRUG
is O
a O
hangover B-ADR
feeling O
the O
next O
day O
. O

And O
i O
throw O
my O
auto O
click O
pen O
into O
a O
glass O
of O
room O
temp O
water O
a O
little O
while O
before O
injecting O
. O

Seems O
like O
less O
of O
a O
stinging B-ADR
feeling O
. O


IHumira B-DRUG
is O
well O
tolerated O
, O
and O
many O
people O
use O
it O
without O
any O
issues O
. O

But O
you O
may O
experience O
more O
frequent O
mild O
infections B-ADR
such O
as O
upper B-ADR
respiratory I-ADR
infections I-ADR
( O
sinusitis B-ADR
, O
rhinitis B-ADR
) O
and O
UTIs B-ADR
. O

As O
with O
any O
medication O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
know O
how O
your O
body O
will O
handle O
the O
drug O
. O



 O
Serious O
side O
effects O
are O
extremely O
rare O
. O

No O
cancer B-ADR
risk O
, O
as O
far O
as O
we O
know O
. O

Let O
your O
doctor O
know O
if O
you O
have O
a O
family O
risk O
of O
MS B-ADR
or O
other O
demyelination B-ADR
disorders O
, O
as O
Humira B-DRUG
can O
trigger O
latent O
MS B-ADR
. O

Humira B-DRUG
can O
also O
cause O
elevated B-ADR
liver I-ADR
values I-ADR
, O
and O
many O
places O
will O
require O
blood O
tests O
every O
2 O
- O
3 O
months O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
the O
NHS O
protocol O
is O
here O
. O



 O
It O
's O
super O
important O
to O
follow O
the O
dosing O
schedule O
. O

If O
you O
stop O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
a O
bit O
, O
your O
body O
may O
develop B-ADR
immunity I-ADR
to O
the O
drug O
. O

Drug B-ADR
immunity I-ADR
can O
happen O
even O
if O
you O
follow O
the O
schedule O
strictly O
; O
it O
's O
just O
something O
the O
body O
does O
( O
newer O
biologics O
are O
less O
affected O
by O
this O
problem O
) O
. O

These O
days O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
often O
taken O
together O
with O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
because O
the O
latter O
can O
prevent O
developing B-ADR
immunity I-ADR
; O
but O
if O
MTX B-DRUG
makes O
you O
sick B-ADR
, O
then O
that O
's O
not O
an O
option O
for O
you O
. O



 O
The O
sad O
fact O
is O
that O
biologics O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
often O
just O
stop B-ADR
working I-ADR
, O
often O
within O
1 O
- O
3 O
years O
. O

People O
with O
psoriatic B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
seem O
particularly O
affected O
by O
this O
kind O
of O
premature O
drug O
failure O
. O

A O
couple O
of O
recent O
studies O
showed O
that O
almost O
half O
of O
all O
arthritis B-ADR
patients O
give O
up O
Humira B-DRUG
after O
less O
than O
12 O
months O
. O

Not O
saying O
it O
will O
happen O
to O
you O
, O
but O
you O
should O
be O
psychologically O
prepared O
for O
then O
possibly O
that O
you O
this O
might O
not O
be O
the O
last O
biologic O
you O
try O
. O


I O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
from O
this O
week O
's O
monday O
and O
I O
've O
started O
to O
feel O
some O
improvements O
. O


Good O
luck O
! O

Hope O
everything O
works O
out O
for O
you O
too O
! O


Mine O
started O
as O
knee O
and O
thigh O
pain B-ADR
when O
I O
was O
19 O
than O
immediately O
turned O
to O
widespread O
aches B-ADR
and O
a O
sensitivity B-ADR
to O
pressure B-ADR
. O

Which O
lead O
me O
to O
think O
I O
had O
fibromyalgia B-ADR
. O

No O
one O
wants O
to O
diagnose O
someone O
that O
young O
with O
fibromyalgia B-ADR
so O
I O
just O
kind O
of O
dealt O
with O
the O
pain B-ADR
for O
years O
but O
once O
I O
started O
working O
an O
office O
job O
the O
pain B-ADR
in O
my O
lower O
back O
started O
and O
just O
got O
worse O
and O
worse O
until O
I O
finally O
went O
back O
to O
the O
doctor O
at O
27 O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
a O
rheumatologist O
and O
through O
an O
X O
- O
ray O
and O
MRI O
it O
was O
pretty O
clear O
my O
SI O
joints O
were O
fusing O
and O
that O
’s O
how O
I O
got O
my O
diagnosis O
and O
started O
Humira B-DRUG

Yes O
me O
. O

I O
have O
Crohn O
’s O
disease O
and O
I O
was O
on O
immuno O
suppressants O
for O
9 O
years O
. O

Most O
recently O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
immuno O
suppressants O
9 O
months O
ago O
and O
have O
been O
doing O
the O
cold O
showers O
and O
breathing O
instead O
. O

A O
recent O
MRI O
showed O
the O
Crohns O
has O
remained O
the O
same O
( O
15 O
cm O
long O
) O
I O
have O
gone O
into O
remission O
and O
have O
normal O
motions O
. O

I O
have O
n’t O
felt O
this O
good O
in O
years O
. O

It O
really O
is O
miraculous O
. O


My O
crohns O
symptoms O
are O
relatively O
mild O
except O
for O
two O
bouts O
of O
arthritis B-ADR
which O
left O
me O
near O
bedridden B-ADR
for O
weeks O
. O

  O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
done O
very O
little O
for O
my O
digestive O
system O
but O
was O
an O
overnight O
miracle O
for O
my O
joints O
. O


Definitely O
bring O
this O
up O
with O
your O
rheumatologist O
. O

This O
started O
happening O
to O
me O
with O
humira B-DRUG
in O
about O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
time O
and O
eventually O
my O
lymph O
nodes O
would O
swell B-ADR
after O
shots O
too O
. O

Doc O
said O
that O
it O
was O
my O
immune O
system O
reacting O
to O
the O
medication O
( O
as O
in O
developing O
antibodies O
against O
the O
medication O
) O
. O

It O
probably O
means O
switching O
meds O
but O
your O
doctor O
might O
try O
to O
get O
as O
much O
time O
as O
you O
can O
with O
it O
before O
switching O
. O


I O
take O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
. O

It O
’s O
the O
only O
one O
of O
the O
DMARDs O
that O
helped O
at O
all O
without O
horrific O
side O
effects O
. O

My O
RA O
has O
gotten O
worse O
though O
, O
so O
I O
’m O
staying O
on O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
and O
adding O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


No O
. O

They O
ca O
n’t O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
that O
I O
’m O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
have O
a O
compromised O
immune O
system O
- O
being O
in O
office O
would O
expose O
me O
to O
100s O
of O
people O
a O
day O
and O
is O
n’t O
a O
risk O
I O
can O
take O
. O

The O
office O
I O
work O
at O
is O
both O
mask O
and O
vaccine O
optional O
. O

The O
alternative O
would O
be O
for O
me O
to O
be O
the O
only O
person O
in O
the O
office O
- O
which O
seems O
way O
less O
reasonable O
than O
just O
allowing O
me O
to O
continue O
working O
remotely O
which O
I O
’ve O
been O
doing O
for O
the O
last O
year O
without O
issue O
. O


Huh O
, O
I O
started O
a O
month O
ago O
and O
my O
voice O
was O
hoarse O
for O
the O
past O
few O
weeks O
. O

It O
’s O
gone O
away O
now O
and O
I O
’ve O
had O
pretty O
good O
response O
! O

Not O
as O
fast O
as O
Humira B-DRUG
or O
as O
good O
as O
Enbrel B-DRUG
yet O
( O
both O
failed O
after O
6 O
mo O
) O
but O
definitely O
better O
. O


I O
’m O
mostly O
pain B-ADR
free O
thanks O
to O
humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
have O
n’t O
had O
a O
full O
blown O
flare B-ADR
since O
starting O
it O
2.5 O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
had O
a O
mini O
flare B-ADR
once O
in O
that O
time O
. O

I O
experience O
occasional O
mild O
pain B-ADR
/ O
soreness B-ADR
in O
my O
lower O
back B-ADR
after O
doing O
certain O
physical O
activities O
due O
to O
the O
joint B-ADR
damage I-ADR
in O
my O
SI O
joints O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
not O
too O
bad O
. O

Prior O
to O
humira B-DRUG
I O
had O
at O
least O
two O
flares B-ADR
a O
year O
with O
pain B-ADR
so O
severe O
I O
struggled O
to O
get O
in O
and O
out O
of O
bed O
( O
could O
n’t O
lift O
my O
legs O
without O
excruciating O
back O
/ O
hip B-ADR
pain I-ADR
) O
. O

The O
last O
one O
was O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
barely O
walk O
. O

There O
is O
hope O
! O


When O
you O
have O
a O
break O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
it O
may O
not O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
it O
was O
previously O
due O
to O
build B-ADR
up I-ADR
of I-ADR
antibodies I-ADR
to O
it O
. O

Or O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
do O
a O
loading O
dose O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
some O
time O
for O
blood O
levels O
to O
return O
to O
therapeutic O
range O
. O

However O
, O
it O
seems O
pretty O
rare O
to O
develop B-ADR
antibodies I-ADR
to O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
possible O
but O
rare O
. O

Most O
cases O
seem O
to O
be O
when O
starting O
out O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O



 O
I O
've O
taken O
a O
break O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
a O
few O
months O
without O
issue O
. O

You O
can O
only O
try O
it O
and O
see O
( O
if O
your O
doctor O
lets O
you O
have O
that O
option O
) O
. O


Sorry O
to O
hear O
, O
been O
doing O
the O
game O
for O
15 O
years O
and O
have O
been O
in O
your O
shoes O
several O
times O
since O
being O
diagnosed O
. O

The O
best O
advice O
I O
can O
offer O
is O
do O
n’t O
give O
up O
, O
be O
the O
squeaky O
wheel O
to O
your O
doctor O
. O

Let O
them O
know O
your O
symptoms O
and O
keep O
bugging O
them O
until O
they O
offer O
some O
sort O
of O
different O
treatment O
options O
. O

Mesalamine B-DRUG
enemas O
or O
suppository O
in O
combo O
with O
humira B-DRUG
could O
help O
before O
switching O
biologics O
. O

Mark O
Cuban O
has O
a O
pharmacy O
that O
offers O
super O
cheap O
medications O
too O
, O
worth O
looking O
into O
because O
UC O
meds O
are O
expensive O
AF O
through O
most O
health O
insurances O
. O

Also O
, O
like O
another O
person O
said O
, O
the O
specific O
brand O
can O
offer O
cheaper O
options O
or O
payment O
help O
through O
their O
websites O
, O
usually O
just O
a O
form O
to O
fill O
out O
. O

We O
are O
all O
here O
to O
help O
and O
support O
anyway O
we O
can O
, O
we O
’re O
all O
in O
the O
struggle O
together O

Are O
you O
on O
Mesalamine B-DRUG
suppositories O
or O
enemas O
? O

The O
< O
worse O
hell O
> O
begins O
when O
the O
uColitis B-ADR
spreads O
up O
past O
10 O
cm O
and O
they O
no O
longer O
work O
. O

And O
then O
you O
have O
to O
move O
into O
drugs O
like O
as O
a O
thought O
you O
’re O
preemie O
. O

We O
ca O
n’t O
stay O
on O
that O
longer O
than O
5 O
- O
10 O
years O
because O
it O
ups O
our O
risk O
of O
cancer B-ADR
. O



 O
If O
/ O
when O
that O
fails O
, O
you O
move O
onto O
a O
biological O
like O
Entyvio B-DRUG
or O
Stelara B-DRUG
, O
and O
then O
if O
that O
fails O
you O
move O
onto O
Remicade B-DRUG
or O
Humira B-DRUG
. O



 O
The O
only O
permanent O
solution O
is O
colon O
removal O
. O

I O
just O
had O
it O
done O
. O

So O
much O
improved O
. O


Taltz B-DRUG
. O

However O
that O
also O
lost B-ADR
effectiveness I-ADR
after O
some O
9 O
months O
. O

Tomorrow O
I O
will O
start O
cosentyx B-DRUG
with O
methotrexate B-DRUG
. O

Doc O
said O
I O
keep O
making O
antibodies O
so O
hopefully O
the O
methotrexate B-DRUG
will O
stop O
me O
from O
doing O
that O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
and O
Taltz B-DRUG
both O
worked O
for O
a O
time O
. O

Cimzia B-DRUG
did O
n't O
work O
for O
me O
. O

Hope O
it O
goes O
well O
for O
you O
. O

I O
liked O
humira B-DRUG
. O


Definitely O
get O
it O
out O
of O
the O
fridge O
at O
least O
an O
hour O
before O
using O
it O
, O
I O
sometimes O
do O
two O
hours O
. O

And O
make O
sure O
the O
alcohol O
is O
completely O
dry O
before O
doing O
the O
injection O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
has O
lots O
of O
instructional O
videos O
on O
their O
website O
too O
! O


Humira B-DRUG
was O
great O
for O
me O
for O
me O
. O

I O
’m O
on O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
now O
because O
it O
helps O
my O
arthritis B-ADR
a O
bit O
more O
, O
but O
Humira B-DRUG
totally O
cleared O
up O
my O
skin O
. O



 O
I O
’m O
glad O
you O
are O
being O
body O
- O
positive O
now O
and O
not O
getting O
hung O
up O
on O
it O
- O
that O
’s O
the O
best O
mindset O
. O

But O
also O
I O
’m O
glad O
you O
wo O
n’t O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
all O
the O
itching B-ADR
and O
discomfort B-ADR
soon O
! O


Yeah O
, O
I O
did O
not O
do O
well O
on O
humira B-DRUG

I O
've O
gained O
35 O
pounds O
( O
so O
far O
) O
in O
4 O
months O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
I O
'm O
jogging O
or O
exercising O
daily O
. O

  O
My O
Rheumatologist O
said O
" O
no O
way O
, O
that O
's O
not O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
" O
but O
she O
also O
is O
concerned O
about O
fatty B-ADR
liver I-ADR
... O
hmmm O
. O

  O
AbbVie O
may O
not O
state O
weight B-ADR
gain I-ADR
as O
a O
side O
effect O
in O
the O
US O
, O
but O
independent O
studies O
in O
other O
countries O
have O
determined O
that O
it O
is O
a O
side O
effect O
for O
10 O
- O
13 O
% O
of O
patients O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

  O
One O
study O
recommends O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
patients O
with O
Anorexia B-ADR
Nervosa I-ADR
to O
gain B-ADR
weight I-ADR
! O


About O
3 O
months O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
me O
. O

Quite O
fast O

The O
funniest O
thing O
said O
on O
my O
chronic O
illness B-ADR
journey O
so O
far O
. O

I O
laugh O
just O
thinking O
about O
it O
: O


 O
So O
I O
'm O
doing O
the O
standard O
acrobatics O
routine O
to O
get O
Humira B-DRUG
covered O
by O
my O
insurance O
. O

My O
rheumatologist O
tells O
me O
to O
call O
them O
if O
I O
have O
n't O
heard O
anything O
from O
their O
office O
in O
a O
week O
because O
they O
have O
to O
handle O
some O
initial O
inquiry O
with O
the O
insurance O
. O

8 O
days O
pass O
and O
I O
call O
the O
office O
back O
. O

The O
rheumatologist O
receptionist O
seems O
surpised O
, O
she O
says O
the O
insurance O
request O
their O
office O
made O
was O
denied O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
indicate O
why O
. O

She O
says O
she O
'll O
hang O
up O
with O
me O
and O
find O
out O
why O
they O
denied O
it O
and O
get O
back O
to O
me O
. O

I O
had O
already O
failed O
out O
of O
a O
chemotherapy O
class O
drug O
so O
we O
were O
all O
very O
confused O
. O

15 O
minutes O
later O
, O
she O
calls O
me O
back O
. O



 O
The O
insurance O
asked O
her O
if O
I O
had O
tried O
using O
over O
the O
counter O
NSAIDs O
. O



 O
NSAIDs O
, O
what O
most O
of O
us O
use O
for O
headaches B-ADR
, O
cramps B-ADR
, O
minor O
injury B-ADR
, O
fever B-ADR
or O
when O
we O
're O
sore B-ADR
from O
a O
work O
out O
day O
. O



 O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
reader O
, O
NSAIDs O
did O
not O
fix O
my O
fibromyalgia B-ADR
and O
arthritis B-ADR
. O

Which O
was O
why O
among O
other O
symptoms O
, O
I O
was O
seeing O
A O
RHEUMATOLOGIST O
! O

! O

! O

Insurance O
is O
so O
fucking O
stupid O
it O
just O
happened O
to O
be O
incredibly O
funny O
in O
this O
instance O
. O


At O
worst O
I O
had O
to O
walk O
on O
the O
outsides O
of O
my O
feet O
because O
the O
balls O
felt O
like O
they O
were O
shattered O
. O

I O
had O
to O
wear O
shoes O
indoors O
. O

I O
had O
to O
sleep O
with O
my O
fingers O
completely O
splayed O
open O
because O
if O
I O
curled O
my O
hands O
at O
night O
it O
would O
be O
hours O
in O
the O
morning O
before O
I O
could O
uncurl O
. O

It O
was O
excruciatingly O
painful O
to O
try O
to O
adjust O
sheets O
at O
night O
. O

I O
had O
a O
newborn O
baby O
and O
changing O
diapers O
was O
miserable O
. O

My O
8 O
year O
old O
daughter O
had O
to O
help O
me O
get O
my O
bra O
on O
and O
off O
or O
get O
shirts O
over O
my O
head O
. O

I O
literally O
could O
not O
write O
end O
of O
the O
year O
thank O
you O
notes O
to O
my O
kids O
teachers O
because O
I O
had O
zero O
strength O
in O
my O
hands O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
grip O
a O
pen O
. O

My O
daughter O
had O
to O
sign O
for O
me O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
gym O
daycare O
. O

I O
could O
not O
braid O
her O
hair O
for O
a O
special O
event O
that O
year O
. O

I O
had O
to O
decorate O
my O
son O
's O
birthday O
cake O
and O
take O
a O
rest O
every O
5 O
minutes O
because O
my O
hands O
hurt O
so O
bad O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
play O
the O
piano O
at O
church O
. O

It O
was O
hard O
to O
use O
toilet O
paper O
in O
the O
bathroom O
. O

It O
took O
me O
10x O
as O
long O
to O
fold O
laundry O
and O
I O
was O
too O
stubborn O
to O
let O
my O
husband O
help O
. O

Random O
joints O
/ O
tendons O
- O
shoulder O
, O
wrist O
, O
forearms O
- O
would O
swell B-ADR
suddenly O
without O
notice O
and O
absolutely O
BURN B-ADR
. O

It O
was O
always O
48 O
hours O
to O
the O
dot O
before O
I O
could O
move O
them O
again O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
keep O
my O
hands O
in O
one O
position O
for O
more O
than O
a O
couple O
minutes O
because O
I O
'd O
get O
8 O
trigger O
fingers O
at O
once O
. O

I O
was O
terrified O
to O
take O
naps O
during O
the O
day O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
my O
hands O
to O
freeze O
up O
. O



 O
I O
am O
absolutely O
100 O
% O
normal O
now O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
have O
been O
for O
a O
year O
. O

I O
regularly O
run O
5 O
+ O
miles O
, O
and O
can O
lift O
heavy O
weights O
/ O
do O
pull O
- O
ups O
( O
among O
regular O
life O
activities O
. O

) O


 O
I O
forgot O
a O
lot O
of O
that O
stuff O
. O

It O
was O
beyond O
miserable O
and O
I O
had O
4 O
little O
kids O
to O
take O
care O
of O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
remember O
I O
have O
RA O
now O
except O
for O
the O
days O
I O
inject O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


Sure O
did O
! O

I O
work O
as O
a O
cashier O
in O
a O
grocery O
store O
and O
in O
childcare O
so O
I O
'm O
really O
exposed O
to O
the O
germs O
I O
guess O
. O

Lol O
I O
'm O
not O
vaccinated O
, O
so O
maybe O
it O
serves O
me O
right O
. O

But O
I O
was O
worried O
about O
long O
term O
effects O
of O
the O
vaccine O
because O
it O
was O
so O
new O
, O
so O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

The O
  O
symptoms O
I O
've O
had O
with O
Covid O

been O
a O
terrible O
headache B-ADR

I O
stopped O
taking O
Bentyl B-DRUG

Canasa B-DRUG
all O
because O
of O
panic B-ADR

heart I-ADR
symptoms O
. O

The O

I O
am O

! O

I O
also O
have O
Crohn O
’s O
disease O
and O
take O
humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
think O
it O
helps O
the O
crohns O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
but O
my O
skin B-ADR
flares I-ADR
are O
a O
big O
problem O
. O

I O
feel O
so O
damn O
gross O
and O
insecure O
. O

I O
’m O
terrified O
of O
having O
to O
wear O
a O
bathing O
suit O
, O
tank O
tops O
, O
or O
regular O
shorts O
. O

It O
does O
n’t O
help O
that O
I O
’m O
struggling O
with O
my O
weight B-ADR
loss I-ADR
, O
which O
is O
making O
everything O
worse O
. O


It O
’s O
two O
alienating O
, O
isolating O
diseases O
that O
is O
a O
huge O
part O
of O
everyday O
life O
. O

You O
just O
do O
your O
best O
daily O
and O
enjoy O
small O
victories O
in O
the O
meantime O
. O



 O
You O
are O
n’t O
alone O
, O
you O
are O
worthy O
of O
love O
, O
and O
you O
deserve O
some O
peace O
in O
your O
life O

🥰 O

Humira B-DRUG
ruined O
me O
until O
I O
got O
on O
the O
Simponi B-DRUG
best O
of O
luck O

YAYY O
! O

! O

i O
m O
glad O
it O
went O
smoothly O
for O
you O
! O

I O
’ve O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
four O
years O
now O
and O
the O
injections O
get O
easier O
and O
easier O
as O
you O
go O
along O
:) O


 O
I O
hope O
it O
works O
for O
you O
and O
you O
can O
continue O
long O
term O
and O
that O
it O
puts O
you O
in O
remission O
:))) O
) O

Humira B-DRUG
actually O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
for O
me O
for O
uveitis B-ADR
( O
after O
15 O
years O
) O
. O

I O
'm O
now O
on O
Cimzia B-DRUG
with O
steroid O
eye O
drops O
. O

I O
may O
add O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
but O
I O
wo O
n't O
want O
to O
because O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
=( O


 O
I O
hope O
you O
get O
through O
the O
insurance O
clearance O
soon O
! O

It O
might O
be O
a O
shitty O
hurdle O
for O
long O
- O
term O
relief O
. O


Really O
sorry O
you O
're O
still O
having O
symptoms O
. O

That O
sounds O
like O
a O
lot O
to O
go O
through O
. O

I O
built O
antibodies O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
it O
helped O
me O
so O
much O
for O
6 O
mths O
. O


> O
I O
have O
the O
citrate O
- O
free O


 O
Great O
decision O
. O

I O
have O
a O
feeling O
your O
experience O
would O
've O
been O
a O
lot O
different O
with O
the O
regular O
Humira B-DRUG
given O
how O
much O
you O
hate O
needles O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

Regular O
Humira B-DRUG
can O
really O
sting B-ADR
. O


I O
had O
four O
years O
of O
proper O
full O
remission O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

It O
’s O
a O
brilliant O
drug O
. O

You O
soon O
get O
used O
to O
injecting O
yourself O
and O
it O
’s O
not O
painful B-ADR
. O

Best O
of O
luck O
with O
it O
. O

Only O
side O
effect O
I O
had O
was O
that O
it O
made O
me O
tired O
. O

I O
could O
work O
with O
that O
- O
just O
take O
it O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
then O
have O
a O
great O
night O
sleep O
! O


I O
had O
a O
Humira B-DRUG
hangover B-ADR
the O
day O
after O
my O
shots O
. O

  O
Exhausted B-ADR
and O
achy O
. O

  O
I O
ended O
up O
switching O
to O
Enbrel B-DRUG
because O
it O
did O
n’t O
go O
away O
and O
I O
’m O
fine O
now O
. O

  O
The O
nurses O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
deny O
it O
but O
even O
my O
doctor O
says O
it O
’s O
50/50 O
with O
people O
getting O
the O
hangovers B-ADR
for O
him O
. O


I O
came O
across O
this O
post O
looking O
up O
costochondritis B-ADR
flare B-ADR
from O
my O
psa O
. O

Insurance O
does O
suck O
. O

It O
’s O
taken O
me O
2.5 O
years O
to O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
and O
the O
past O
8 O
months O
of O
it O
just O
to O
get O
the O
humira B-DRUG
. O

Only O
one O
dose O
in O
, O
fingers O
crossed O
. O

I O
hope O
it O
gets O
better O
for O
you O
. O


I O
was O
told O
to O
delay O
it O
and O
stop O
my O
azathioprine B-DRUG
until O
I O
had O
recovered O
. O

I O
tested O
positive O
8 O
days O
ago O
and O
my O
humira B-DRUG
was O
due O
2 O
days O
later O
. O

I O
only O
ended O
up O
delaying O
it O
by O
3 O
days O
though O
as O
covid O
was O
really O
mild O
for O
me O
. O


Aye O
. O

I O
'd O
be O
upset O
if O
I O
was O
in O
OP O
's O
shoes O
and O
did O
n't O
get O
some O
kind O
of O
biologic O
after O
all O
that O
. O



 O
OP O
: O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Remicade B-DRUG
( O
or O
generics O
) O
are O
the O
most O
likely O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
US O
. O



 O
I O
would O
n't O
get O
too O
adventurous O
if O
you O
're O
tapering O

Maybe O
once O
you O

 O
You O
should O
n't O
need O
more O
scans O

severe O

directly O
to O
strong O
medicine O

Assuming O
you O

Prednisone B-DRUG

that O

the O
" O
oh O
shit O
they O
're O
flaring O
and O
we O
need O
something O
tomorrow O
" O
medicine O
. O

The O
current O
standard O
for O
treatment O
( O
according O
to O
my O
GI O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
) O
is O
to O
attack O
Crohn O
's O
with O
a O
biologic O
fast O
to O
prevent O
further O
damage O
. O

There O
* O
are O
* O
other O
medications O
, O
like O
Pentasa B-DRUG
and O
Budesonide B-DRUG
, O
that O
can O
treat O
Crohn O
's O
, O
but O
they O
tend O
to O
work O
best O
for O
milder O
cases O
. O

Pentasa B-DRUG
did O
heck O
- O
all O
for O
me O
, O
and O
Budesonide B-DRUG
was O
okay O
as O
a O
stopgap O
-- O
I O
could O
function O
- O
ish O
, O
and O
eat O
things O
like O
... O
white O
bread O
, O
chicken O
, O
and O
turkey O
. O



 O
Speaking O
of O
, O
when O
you O
simply O
can O
not O
eat O
any O
more O
rice O
as O
the O
only O
real O
food O
, O
baked O
chicken O
( O
do O
n't O
dare O
put O
oil O
on O
it O
) O
, O
turkey O
( O
similarly O
plain O
) O
, O
and O
white O
bread O
are O
possibilities O
. O

Try O
these O
separately O
first O
to O
see O
if O
they O
're O
okay O
for O
you O
. O

If O
they O
are O
and O
you O
dare O
to O
make O
a O
sandwich O
, O
limit O
condiments O
and O
try O
one O
at O
a O
time O
. O


I O
’m O
on O
entyvio B-DRUG
so O
maybe O
it O
’s O
different O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
my O
GI O
said O
if O
I O
do O
n’t O
have O
a O
fever B-ADR
or O
Covid O
, O
I O
can O
go O
ahead O
with O
my O
infusions O

I O
’m O
HLA O
- O
B27 O
positive O
with O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
of O
AS O
. O

In O
the O
past O
decade O
I O
’ve O
become O
immune O
to O
enbrel B-DRUG
, O
remicade B-DRUG
, O
simponi B-DRUG
, O
and O
humira B-DRUG
. O

Now O
on O
cosentyx B-DRUG
with O
varying O
results O
. O


I O
have O
n’t O
done O
as O
much O
research O
on O
Entyvio B-DRUG
but O
my O
GI O
highly O
recommends O
it O
. O

It O
’s O
what O
he O
wanted O
me O
on O
originally O
but O
insurance O
would O
n’t O
pay O
for O
it O
( O
lol O
) O
. O

However O
, O
it O
’s O
almost O
certainly O
what O
I O
’ll O
be O
going O
on O
next O
if O
I O
ever O
fail O
Humira B-DRUG
. O



 O
I O
believe O
he O
said O
it O
has O
one O
of O
the O
lowest O
failure O
rates O
of O
the O
biologics O
but O
the O
main O
reason O
is O
because O
the O
way O
it O
works O
is O
more O
targeted O
. O

Where O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
it O
’s O
as O
I O
described O
where O
you O
’re O
more O
generally O
susceptible O
to O
bacterial B-ADR
infections I-ADR
, O
Entyvio B-DRUG
is O
almost O
exclusively O
more O
susceptible O
to O
bacterial B-ADR
infections I-ADR
located O
solely O
in O
the O
gut O
which O
is O
Humira B-DRUG
’s O
biggest O
weakness B-ADR
in O
its O
safety O
profile O
. O



 O
That O
’s O
pretty O
much O
where O
my O
knowledge O
stops O
though O
. O

I O
believe O
living O
your O
life O
normally O
while O
on O
it O
is O
the O
same O
but O
I O
’m O
much O
less O
familiar O
with O
the O
long O
- O
term O
safety O
profile O
. O

I O
do O
know O
it O
’s O
newer O
so O
it O
likely O
is O
going O
to O
have O
less O
long O
- O
term O
safety O
studies O
than O
Humira B-DRUG
tho O
which O
are O
plentiful O
since O
it O
’s O
been O
around O
for O
decades O
. O


Your O
Humira B-DRUG
ambassador O
can O
steer O
you O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
to O
get O
it O
covered O
. O

I O
hit O
the O
16k O
max O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Abbvie O
covered O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
year O
. O

At O
first O
they O
wanted O
me O
to O
pay O
the O
copay O
out O
of O
pocket O
. O

I O
told O
them O
I O
could O
n't O
afford O
it O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
then O
covered O
it O
all O
. O


This O
is O
how O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
started O
for O
Crohns O
, O
I O
think O
. O

Do O
you O
also O
have O
inflammatory B-ADR
bowel I-ADR
disease I-ADR
? O


I O
'm O
currently O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

  O
For O
years O
I O
was O
taking O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
but O
, O
like O
most O
people O
, O
hated O
the O
side O
effects O
. O

  O
Within O
three O
months O
of O
starting O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
the O
large O
patches O
of O
psoriasis B-ADR
had O
disappeared O
- O
it O
was O
life O
changing O
. O

 

 O
The O
class O
of O
these O
drugs O
is O
called O
biologics O
and O
there O
are O
several O
available O
. O

  O
But O
, O
they O
are O
expensive O
for O
the O
government O
to O
subsidise O
, O
so O
you O
have O
to O
try O
cheaper O
options O
before O
being O
granted O
a O
script O
. O

  

 O
Hope O
this O
helps O
. O


I O
did O
n’t O
have O
great O
results O
with O
accutane B-DRUG
but O
it O
’s O
worth O
a O
try O
. O

My O
derm O
is O
saying O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
but O
I O
’m O
worried O
about O
the O
side O
effects O
. O


I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
Crohn O
's O
back O
in O
2019 O
and O
prescribed O
humira B-DRUG
.. O
i O
did O
n't O
take O
it O
cause O
i O
was O
scared O
of O
side O
effects O
and O
basically O
went O
untreated O
for O
2 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
.. O
which O
led O
to O
this O
... O
so O
i O
d O
go O
back O
and O
actually O
take O
the O
medication O

as O
Humira B-DRUG
bud O
had O
to O
quit O
because O
of O
allergic B-ADR
reactions I-ADR
. O

Now O
I O
'm O
on O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
and O
that O
also O
works O
the O
same O
. O


I O
have O
gotten O
lucky O
. O

I O
have O
n’t O
had O
any O
side O
effects O
and O
feel O
significantly O
better O
so O
far O
. O

I O
’m O
hoping O
it O
lasts O
. O

She O
also O
wants O
to O
put O
me O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
as O
well O
. O


Similar O
problems O
, O
also O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
have O
same O
issues O
with O
my O
ears O
. O

Just O
saw O
a O
derm O
and O
it O
’s O
psoriasis B-ADR

Thank O
you O
for O
your O
response O
! O

I O
just O
got O
off O
the O
phone O
with O
a O
Humira B-DRUG
rep O
and O
they O
did O
an O
assessment O
and O
said O
all O
the O
medication O
was O
fine O
to O
use O

I O
’m O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
put O
me O
in O
remission O
for O
within O
a O
week O
of O
using O
it O
. O

It O
has O
worked O
wonders O
for O
me O

So O
humira B-DRUG
can O
take O
a O
while O
to O
start O
working O
. O

I O
do O
n’t O
remember O
for O
sure O
but O
I O
think O
it O
can O
take O
up O
to O
3 O
months O
. O

Do O
n’t O
quote O
me O
on O
that O
tho O
I O
would O
ask O
your O
gi O
. O

That O
being O
said O
I O
’m O
not O
really O
understanding O
why O
you O
’ll O
be O
off O
the O
pred O
soon O
? O

Especially O
if O
you O
’re O
still O
bleeding B-ADR
. O

Idk O
your O
dosage O
tho O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
’re O
not O
in O
any O
pain B-ADR
love O
. O


Oof O
, O
VERY O
wary O
of O
switching O
upon O
hearing O
that O
. O

The O
boils B-ADR
I O
dealt O
with O
while O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
were O
no O
joke O
. O

I O
'm O
honestly O
fine O
with O
having O
eczema B-ADR
on O
my O
hands O
if O
my O
Crohn O
's O
is O
well O
managed O
. O


When O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
started O
losing O
its O
efficacy O
my O
doctor O
switch O
me O
to O
weekly O
injections O
instead O
of O
bi O
weekly O
since O
we O
knew O
Humira B-DRUG
worked O
it O
just O
did O
n’t O
last O
the O
full O
two O
weeks O
… O

I O
am O
currently O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Omeprazole B-DRUG
. O

They O
're O
incredible O
but O
the O
headaches B-ADR
for O
the O
first O
week O
of O
takin O
Omeprazole B-DRUG
were O
awful O

Enbrel B-DRUG
- O
6 O
years O
but O
I O
only O
stopped O
because O
they O
diagnosed O
me O
with O
Crohns O
as O
well O
as O
psoriatic B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
and O
enbrel B-DRUG
is O
n’t O
as O
good O
at O
Crohns O
supposedly O
. O



 O
Humira B-DRUG
- O
4 O
years O
so O
far O
. O

Recently O
did O
a O
Prometheus O
test O
to O
increase O
it O
to O
weekly O
( O
insurance O
said O
no O
lol O
) O
but O
it O
showed O
no O
antibodies O
. O


Adalimumab B-DRUG
( O
humira B-DRUG
) O
has O
been O
an O
absolute O
game O
changer O
for O
me O
, O
I O
still O
get O
the O
odd O
flare B-ADR
but O
my O
life O
does O
n’t O
revolve O
around O
caring O
for O
my O
skin O
and O
trying O
to O
close O
wounds O
anymore O
. O

I O
take O
80 O
mg O
every O
two O
weeks O
. O


None O
of O
the O
topical O
treatments O
or O
tablets O
helped O
me O
at O
all O
, O
I O
have O
an O
ileostomy B-ADR
and O
IBD B-ADR
too O
so O
I O
generally O
have O
pretty O
shit O
absorption O
of O
oral O
meds O
anyway O
. O


I O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
40ml O
every O
other O
week O
in O
May O
and O
it O
had O
no O
noticeable O
effect O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
my O
symptoms O
got O
much O
worse O
. O

   O
My O
GI O
tested O
for O
levels O
and O
antibodies O
September O
. O

  O
Based O
on O
those O
results O
, O
Humira B-DRUG
frequency O
was O
doubled O
( O
40ml O
/ O
wk O
) O
and O
I O
started O
6MP O
. O

    O
My O
symptoms O
continued O
to O
worsen O
and O
I O
also O
had O
pretty O
bad O
side O
effects O
. O

But O
last O
week O
( O
week O
7 O
of O
the O
new O
regimen O
) O
it O
was O
like O
a O
switch O
flipped O
and O
many O
of O
my O
symptoms O
improved O
dramatically O
, O
literally O
overnight O
. O

  O
The O
side O
effects O
have O
also O
subsided O
, O
and O
I O
am O
cautiously O
optimistic O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
years O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
sent O
me O
back O
to O
normal O
within O
about O
48 O
hours O
and O
it O
was O
honestly O
an O
incredible O
feeling O
. O

Obviously O
the O
long O
term O
damage O
done O
by O
AS O
is O
still O
there O
but O
the O
constant O
aches B-ADR
and O
pains B-ADR
are O
gone O
. O

I O
wish O
you O
a O
great O
experience O
and O
make O
sure O
you O
come O
back O
for O
advice O
if O
you O
need O
any O
! O


If O
you O
barely O
qualify O
for O
it O
and O
are O
not O
on O
immuno O
suppressing O
drugs O
i O
do O
n’t O
think O
riding O
it O
out O
is O
a O
bad O
call O
. O

  O
At O
all O
. O

  O
I O
am O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

  O
So O
i O
worry O
that O
even O
though O
i O
am O
triple O
vaxxed O
as O
well O
, O
my O
last O
shot O
was O
8 O
months O
ago O
, O
and O
Humira B-DRUG
might O
make O
my O
immune O
system O
lag O
in O
its O
response O
to O
it O
. O

  O
So O
that O
is O
why O
i O
figured O
i O
needed O
the O
assist O
to O
clear O
it O
. O

  O
And O
again O
, O
because O
i O
need O
to O
get O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
anyway O
, O
what O
is O
the O
real O
point O
of O
making O
it O
harder O
for O
me O
when O
i O
will O
be O
lowering O
my O
immune O
system O
again O
here O
soon O
enough O
once O
i O
get O
over O
it O
. O


In O
the O
beginning O
I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
inject O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
myself O
. O

I O
had O
to O
work O
on O
it O
for O
more O
then O
a O
year O
together O
with O
a O
nurse O
and O
phycatrist O
. O

I O
went O
to O
the O
hospital O
every O
week O
and O
I O
slowly O
worked O
up O
the O
courage O
to O
infected O
the O
it O
myself O
. O

Now O
almost O
two O
years O
later O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
about O
it O
I O
just O
do O
it O
ad O
a O
part O
of O
my O
daily O
rutin O
. O

Anyway O
, O
my O
point O
is O
that O
if O
you O
have O
problems O
injecting O
you O
can O
work O
through O
it O
. O


Yep O
... O
although O
I O
also O
have O
fibromyalgia B-ADR
that O
was O
diagnosed O
back O
in O
2004 O
and O
osteoarthritis B-ADR
in O
my O
hands O
. O

So O
pain B-ADR
and O
I O
are O
old O
" O
buddies O
" O
. O



 O
Started O
Humira B-DRUG
in O
June O
and O
have O
noticed O
a O
bit O
of O
improvement O
but O
still O
have O
really O
stiff B-ADR
back I-ADR
especially O
in O
the O
morning O
plus O
hip O
, O
shoulder O
, O
and O
neck B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O


I O
see O
my O
doctor O
again O
Monday O
for O
injections O
! O

We O
’re O
going O
to O
try O
a O
NEW O
round O
of O
meds O
with O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
! O

I O
get O
these O
, O
this O
size O
still O
frequently O
, O
even O
after O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

It O
’s O
been O
a O
nightmare B-ADR
trying O
to O
find O
what O
works O
for O
me O
! O

! O



 O
Thank O
you O
so O
much O
! O


Thanks O
! O

My O
flare B-ADR
is O
not O
so O
severe O
at O
the O
moment O
and O
my O
GI O
is O
thinking O
to O
change O
my O
medication O
to O
Adalimumab B-DRUG
( O
Humira B-DRUG
) O

I O
use O
their O
assistance O
program O
. O

They O
send O
me O
free O
humira B-DRUG
every O
6 O
weeks O
. O


Thank O
you O
:) O
he O
's O
not O
ready O
to O
start O
humira B-DRUG
yet O
, O
hopefully O
when O
he O
's O
ready O
it O
will O
help O
him O
. O

We O
'll O
try O
to O
keep O
movin O
' O
in O
the O
meantime O

So O
I O
was O
getting O
uveitis B-ADR
pretty O
often O
. O

And O
needed O
steroid B-DRUG
drops O
. O

Once O
it O
was O
so O
bad O
I O
needed O
an O
injection O
in O
my O
eye O
. O

Did O
n’t O
feel O
it O
but O
sounded O
gross O
. O

My O
new O
rheumatologist O
strongly O
suggested O
Humira B-DRUG
instead O
of O
Cimiza O
which O
Emmy O
previous O
rheumatologist O
recommended O
. O

As O
per O
my O
new O
rheumatologist O
, O
who O
’s O
wonderful O
and O
explains O
everything O
, O
humira B-DRUG
has O
shown O
to O
be O
effective O
is O
managing O
uveitis B-ADR
. O

It O
may O
be O
worth O
a O
talk O
, O
if O
you O
are O
n’t O
already O
on O
biológics O
. O

I O
take O
them O
every O
two O
weeks O
. O



 O
I O
know O
they O
are O
working O
because O
this O
season O
I O
have O
had O
lots O
of O
minor O
eye B-ADR
aches I-ADR
. O

And O
for O
me O
, O
that O
9/10 O
would O
indicate O
a O
flare B-ADR
up O
. O

But O
all O
four O
times O
I O
’ve O
gone O
to O
the O
ophthalmologist O
it O
was O
n’t O
a O
flare O
. O

Once O
I O
had O
a O
little O
pressure B-ADR
in O
one O
eye O
. O

Which O
as O
per O
the O
specialist O
suggested O
that O
the O
humira B-DRUG
was O
working O
on O
containing O
the O
flare B-ADR
. O



 O
Hope O
you O
find O
what O
works O
best O
for O
you O
. O


I O
’m O
on O
2 O
now O
. O

Started O
Humira B-DRUG
September O
2019 O
. O

Had O
some O
effects O
but O
not O
full O
. O

Am O
actually O
on O
a O
permanent O
feeding O
tube O
now O
, O
which O
has O
helped O
, O
being O
on O
formula O
. O

I O
started O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
for O
severe O
eczema B-ADR
this O
May O
and O
it O
has O
finally O
made O
being O
around O
good O
tolerable O
, O
which O
I O
had O
n’t O
gotten O
to O
before O
. O

And O
other O
symptoms B-ADR
like O
fatigue B-ADR
are O
n’t O
as O
bad O
as O
they O
were O
. O

So O
my O
guts O
are O
normalized O
now O
, O
but O
I O
have O
no O
desire O
to O
eat O
at O
all O
. O


But O
it O
’s O
very O
scary O
being O
on O
2 O
biologics O
during O
covid O

I O
am O
not O
, O
just O
on O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
right O
now O

I O
’ve O
had O
glaucoma B-ADR
surgery O
in O
both O
eyes O
. O

My O
original O
doctor O
told O
me O
that O
it O
would O
disfigure O
my O
face O
( O
completely O
untrue O
) O
so O
I O
was O
terrified O
when O
my O
current O
doctor O
started O
talking O
about O
it O
. O

I O
pushed O
back O
for O
months O
. O

When O
it O
came O
down O
to O
it O
, O
methotrexate B-DRUG
was O
not O
something O
I O
was O
okay O
with O
doing O
for O
my O
body O
( O
no O
one O
ever O
talked O
to O
me O
about O
humira B-DRUG
just O
to O
be O
open O
) O
, O
so O
I O
agreed O
to O
the O
surgery O
. O

Of O
course O
everyone O
is O
different O
, O
but O
they O
were O
a O
piece O
of O
cake O
to O
recover O
from O
and O
have O
been O
holding O
up O
perfectly O
with O
the O
addition O
of O
steroid O
implants O
. O

The O
only O
surgeries O
that O
were O
easier O
were O
cataracts B-ADR
. O



 O
I O
am O
so O
incredibly O
glad O
that O
I O
found O
doctors O
who O
supported O
me O
going O
the O
surgical O
route O
with O
this O
condition O
. O

It O
was O
the O
right O
choice O
for O
me O
, O
but O
obviously O
only O
you O
know O
your O
body O
and O
your O
priorities O
. O

I O
was O
cleared O
to O
work O
out O
after O
two O
weeks O
with O
both O
surgeries O
, O
and O
the O
only O
restriction O
that O
lasted O
a O
month O
was O
regarding O
heavy O
weights O
( O
over O
50lbs O
) O
. O

I O
was O
back O
to O
work O
in O
an O
extremely O
active O
environment O
within O
a O
week O
of O
the O
procedures O
. O



 O
Not O
to O
say O
it O
is O
n’t O
a O
big O
deal O
in O
any O
way O
shape O
or O
form O
, O
but O
if O
surgery O
seems O
right O
for O
you O
and O
you O
trust O
your O
doctors O
, O
it O
can O
be O
a O
blip O
in O
the O
timeline O
and O
you O
do O
n’t O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
immunosuppressants O
. O

Good O
luck O
! O

Trust O
your O
body O
! O


Is O
It O
worse O
than O
before O
starting O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
? O


I O
started O
on O
budesonide B-DRUG
in O
December O
last O
year O
and O
was O
changed O
to O
prednisolone B-DRUG
at O
the O
end O
of O
January O
. O

I O
started O
with O
a O
normal O
8 O
week O
taper O
but O
when O
I O
got O
down O
to O
20 O
mg O
a O
day O
they O
increased O
it O
again O
to O
25 O
mg O
a O
day O
because O
any O
lower O
than O
that O
and O
my O
Crohns O
was O
getting O
worse O
. O

I O
was O
on O
25 O
mg O
a O
day O
for O
months O
and O
then O
started O
a O
normal O
taper O
again O
, O
then O
they O
tried O
to O
taper O
me O
down O
slowly O
using O
hydrocortisone B-DRUG
instead O
of O
prednisolone B-DRUG
since O
some O
short O
synacthen O
tests O
showed O
I O
was O
n’t O
producing O
any O
steroids B-DRUG
of O
my O
own O
, O
so O
they O
kept O
me O
on O
a O
low O
dose O
of O
hydrocortisone B-DRUG
( O
5 O
mg O
a O
day O
) O
, O
then O
they O
did O
another O
short O
synacthen O
test O
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
. O

I O
had O
been O
feeling O
very O
unwell B-ADR
, O
dizzy B-ADR
, O
blurred B-ADR
vision I-ADR
, O
lightheadedness B-ADR
, O
exhaustion B-ADR
, O
etc O
. O

They O
could O
n’t O
detect O
any O
cortisol O
in O
my O
blood O
so O
I O
got O
a O
phone O
call O
from O
my O
consultant O
whilst O
I O
was O
at O
uni O
telling O
me O
to O
get O
home O
now O
and O
take O
extra O
hydrocortisone B-DRUG
( O
20 O
mg O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
10 O
mg O
in O
the O
afternoon O
) O
, O
I O
then O
got O
an O
urgent O
appointment O
with O
an O
endocrinologist O
to O
put O
me O
on O
hormone O
replacement O
therapy O
since O
my O
adrenal O
gland O
had O
“ O
gone O
to O
sleep O
” O
due O
to O
me O
being O
on O
the O
steroids B-DRUG
, O
this O
can O
last O
a O
long O
time O
, O
even O
a O
few O
years O
if O
your O
adrenal O
gland O
does O
decide O
to O
“ O
wake O
up O
” O
again O
, O
there O
is O
a O
chance O
it O
wo O
n’t O
. O



 O
Now O
I O
have O
to O
come O
off O
the O
adalimumab B-DRUG
due O
to O
potential O
complications O
and O
I O
am O
back O
on O
prednisolone B-DRUG
on O
an O
8 O
week O
taper O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
they O
can O
do O
about O
my O
adrenal O
glands O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
they O
need O
to O
wait O
until O
I O
am O
back O
off O
the O
prednisolone B-DRUG
but O
going O
on O
it O
again O
obviously O
prolongs O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
your O
adrenal O
gland O
takes O
to O
recover O
, O
if O
it O
recovers O
. O



 O
I O
take O
it O
you O
have O
just O
had O
a O
single O
8 O
week O
taper O
this O
year O

You O
should O
be O
absolutely O
fine O
with O

I O
get O

there O
are O

 O
I O
'd O
advise O

If O

My O
boyfriend O
takes O
the O
at O
home O
injection O
humira B-DRUG
pens O
. O

He O
switched O
jobs O
last O
year O
and O
had O
a O
lapse O
in O
insurance O
for O
6 O
months O
. O

  O
His O
doctor O
got O
all O
the O
paperwork O
for O
him O
to O
fill O
out O
and O
signed O
him O
up O
on O
this O
program O
and O
he O
only O
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
5 O
per O
box O
. O


I O
no O
longer O
have O
severe O
active O
disease O
. O

But O
it O
used O
to O
be O
active O
( O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
severe O
) O
. O

I O
've O
been O
on O
stellara B-DRUG
for O
5 O
or O
6 O
years O
now O
. O

Doing O
really O
well O
right O
now O
. O

Stellara B-DRUG
is O
super O
easy O
to O
take O
/ O
inject O
. O

Much O
easier O
than O
humira B-DRUG
. O


I O
had O
no O
major O
side O
effects O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

  O
One O
exception O
is O
diarhrea B-ADR
sometimes O
for O
2 O
- O
3 O
days O
. O

  O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
on O
the O
other O
hand O
was O
poisoning B-ADR
me O
so O
I O
had O
to O
come O
off O
of O
it O
. O

  O
The O
only O
down O
side O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
me O
is O
that O
it O
did O
n’t O
cure O
me O
it O
only O
lowered O
my O
symptoms O
so O
I O
was O
n’t O
in O
horrible O
pain B-ADR
every O
minute O
24/7 O
. O

  O
If O
biologics O
did O
nt O
exist O
i O
m O
not O
sure O
I O
would O
have O
been O
around O
this O
long O
. O


I O
initially O
failed O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
then O
added O
a O
DMARD O
to O
increase O
its O
effectiveness O
. O

I O
got O
a O
reaction B-ADR
like O
this O
one O
time O
, O
and O
it O
happened O
well O
after O
the O
point O
when O
Humira B-DRUG
was O
working O
well O
again O
. O

It O
was O
n’t O
much O
longer O
after O
though O
that O
Humira B-DRUG
started O
giving O
me O
really O
bad O
side O
effects O
that O
lead O
to O
my O
eventual O
stopping O
the O
med O
. O

I O
felt O
a O
little O
unwell B-ADR
then O
I O
lost B-ADR
my I-ADR
appetite I-ADR
then O
I O
started O
vomiting B-ADR
on O
a O
two O
week O
cycle O
over O
the O
course O
of O
a O
3 O
month O
period O
and O
it O
happened O
quick O
. O



 O
I O
really O
wish O
I O
had O
called O
my O
doc O
a O
lot O
earlier O
about O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
side O
effects O
than O
I O
did O
. O

I O
’m O
still O
recovering O
from O
them O
and O
it O
’s O
been O
8 O
weeks O
since O
my O
last O
shot O
. O

I O
am O
having O
a O
much O
harder O
time O
with O
this O
recovery O
than O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
with O
any O
of O
my O
issues O
, O
including O
my O
AS O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

I O
lost B-ADR
a I-ADR
significant I-ADR
portion I-ADR
of I-ADR
my I-ADR
body I-ADR
weight I-ADR
and O
I O
am O
now O
seeing O
new O
doctors O
for O
that O
and O
am O
trying O
to O
get O
my O
systems O
back O
in O
working O
order O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
not O
been O
easy O
. O

I O
never O
considered O
this O
rash B-ADR
at O
all O
related O
and O
I O
never O
even O
mentioned O
it O
to O
my O
doctor O
because O
it O
only O
happened O
once O
. O

These O
medications O
are O
not O
a O
joke O
and O
side O
effects O
need O
to O
be O
taken O
very O
seriously O
. O

They O
are O
a O
godsend O
for O
many O
, O
but O
not O
all O
. O

Please O
call O
your O
doctor O
! O

! O


That O
's O
basically O
the O
same O
thing O
the O
Drs O
told O
me O
when O
I O
had O
my O
colonoscopy O
in O
Feb O
2020 O
. O

Diagnosed O
with O
AS O
in O
2016 O
( O
Humira B-DRUG
) O
and O
was O
convinced O
I O
had O
Crohn O
's O
, O
but O
it O
's O
inflammation B-ADR
from O
elsewhere O
hanging O
out O
in O
my O
intestines O
and O
causing O
colitis B-ADR
. O

Good O
times O
. O


Biologics O
are O
really O
common O
in O
the O
UK O
but O
require O
an O
application O
for O
funding O
( O
that O
your O
consultant O
does O
! O

) O


 O
I O
went O
: O

 O
I O
've O
been O
stable O
on O
entiviyo B-DRUG
for O
4 O
years O
now O
! O



 O
They O
only O
moved O
me O
to O
biologics O
after O
I O
kept O
flaring O
on O
the O
other O
meds O
( O
ended O
up O
in O
hospital O
twice O
) O


 O
I O
would O
honestly O
be O
pushing O
for O
biologics O
as O
soon O
as O
! O

They O
re O
really O
the O
only O
meds O
that O
work O
😅 O

This O
is O
why O
I O
stopped O
biologics O
. O

I O
was O
sick B-ADR
every O
time O
you O
turned O
around O
. O

To O
answer O
your O
question O
, O
your O
immune O
system O
is O
suppressed O
the O
entire O
time O
you O
’re O
on O
them O
, O
it O
does O
n’t O
get O
stronger O
. O

You O
would O
n’t O
want O
it O
to O
, O
as O
the O
medicine O
would O
technically O
stop B-ADR
working I-ADR
if O
it O
did O
. O

The O
misconception O
about O
auto O
immune O
diseases O
is O
that O
the O
immune O
system O
sucks O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
it O
is O
VERY O
good O
, O
better O
than O
average O
. O

It O
just O
attacks O
your O
body O
instead O
of O
foreign O
threats O
. O

That O
being O
said O
, O
when O
you O
get O
sick B-ADR
on O
biologics O
you O
are O
supposed O
to O
stop O
taking O
them O
. O

Do O
not O
do O
your O
next O
injection O
. O

Wait O
until O
you O
feel O
better O
and O
then O
you O
can O
start O
again O
. O

Give O
your O
body O
time O
to O
heal O
up O
. O

The O
other O
unfortunate O
downside O
to O
this O
is O
the O
more O
you O
stop O
and O
start O
biologics O
, O
the O
less O
they O
work O
each O
time O
. O



 O
All O
this O
information O
was O
from O
my O
rheumatologist O
. O

I O
have O
had O
two O
. O

One O
was O
amazing O
, O
one O
was O
meh O
, O
but O
both O
told O
me O
the O
same O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Enbrel B-DRUG
and O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
and O
had O
the O
same O
issue O
with O
them O
all O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
get O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
but O
insurance O
was O
n’t O
having O
it O
even O
tho O
the O
doc O
said O
yes O
. O

I O
eventually O
decided O
to O
stop O
taking O
black O
box O
drugs O
after O
lots O
of O
research O
and O
deciding O
the O
risk O
factors O
were O
n’t O
worth O
it O
, O
especially O
during O
peak O
Covid O
and O
I O
’m O
only O
in O
my O
early O
30s O
. O



 O
I O
would O
suggest O
if O
this O
becomes O
a O
frequent O
issue O
to O
talk O
to O
your O
rheumy O
about O
getting O
on O
something O
that O
works O
better O
with O
your O
particular O
system O
and O
maybe O
you O
will O
get O
lucky O
and O
find O
something O
that O
does O
n’t O
keep O
you O
sick B-ADR
all O
the O
time O
. O

Tons O
of O
people O
have O
great O
experiences O
when O
they O
find O
the O
right O
biologic O
for O
them O
. O

But O
if O
this O
is O
a O
one O
off O
I O
would O
stop O
the O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
take O
tons O
of O
vitamins O
, O
soup O
, O
etc O
like O
you O
would O
normally O
and O
once O
you O
’re O
better O
to O
start O
again O
. O


Also O
have O
HS O
, O
looks O
exactly O

that O
was O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
now O
, O
this O
was O
all O
between O
2013 O
- O
2014 O
so O
they O
might O
do O
things O
a O
bit O
differently O
now O
and O
be O
a O
bit O
quicker O

This O
was O
NHS O

which O
might O
also O
be O
a O
bit O
different O
depending O
on O
what O
part O
of O
the O

you O
're O
in O

I O
know O

glad O

hear O
yours O

Did O
you O
ever O
have O
any O
eye O
or O
sinus B-ADR
issues I-ADR
while O
on O
humira B-DRUG
also O
? O

All O
sorts O
of O
stuff O
I O
’ve O
been O
blaming O
on O
pregnancy O
I O
wonder O
if O
humira B-DRUG
is O
the O
culprit- O
sonervous O
to O
switch O
off O
because O
it O
’s O
done O
a O
fantastic O
job O
putting O
my O
crohns O
into O
remission O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
is O
right O
, O
you O
might O
mean O

 O
Regardless O
, O
the O
solution O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
get O
me O
to O
is O
to O
have O
the O
government O
pay O
for O
her O
medicine O
. O

Maybe O
that O
is O
the O
solution O
. O

We O
can O
have O
the O
government O
pay O
for O
prescriptions O
. O

Although O
I O
'm O
sure O
that O
is O
n't O
what O
you O
are O
proposing O
:) O



 O
In O
my O
case O
, O
my O
wife O
has O
an O
autoimmune O
issue O
. O

We O
, O
at O
one O
time O
, O
paid O
$ O
2,500 O
a O
month O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
found O
this O
on O
goodRX O
( O
https://www.goodrx.com/humira O
) O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
remember O
paying O
what O
it O
says O
. O

It O
was O
a O
pen O
every O
other O
week O
. O

We O
ended O
up O
signing O
up O
for O
their O
manufactor O
's O
thing O
. O

That O
got O
it O
down O
quite O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
I O
never O
had O
to O
worry O
about O
not O
meeting O
my O
deductible O
. O

I O
think O
we O
are O
at O
80 O
- O
90 O
dollars O
a O
month O
now O
with O
her O
new O
pills O
, O
so O
that O
is O
better O
. O

The O
irony O
is O
that O
goodRx O
, O
with O
our O
current O
meds O
, O
is O
better O
than O
my O
insurance O
, O
so O
it O
does O
n't O
count O
against O
our O
deductable O
. O

:) O



 O
The O
point O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
make O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
are O
making O
medical O
decisions O
based O
on O
how O
much O
money O
they O
have O
. O

If O
my O
mother O
- O
in O
- O
law O
had O
more O
money O
she O
would O
just O
buy O
it O
because O
it O
did O
n't O
matter O
. O

For O
insulin O
, O
since O
he O
is O
a O
single O
divorced O
person O
with O
2 O
kids O
, O
low O
income O
is O
16,000 O
. O

As O
a O
librarian O
, O
he O
makes O
more O
than O
that O
. O

I O
for O
one O
would O
like O
to O
retire O
early O
or O
start O
my O
own O
small O
business O
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
insurance O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
changed O
my O
life O
, O
most O
of O
the O
time O
I O
feel O
pain B-ADR
free O
, O
except O
for O
a O
flare B-ADR
last O
year O
( O
covid O
) O
I O
’ve O
been O
able O
to O
lead O
a O
normal O
life O
, O
I O
do O
handywork O
around O
the O
house O
, O
ride O
my O
motorcycle O
everyday O
, O
travel O
etc O
… O
wish O
you O
all O
the O
best O
! O


Hey O
I O
feel O
you O
, O
I O
went O
through O
all O
possible O
medications O
: O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
Stelara B-DRUG
, O
Entivio B-DRUG
, O
Remicade B-DRUG
, O
Azathioprin B-DRUG
, O
I O
think O
even O
MTX B-DRUG
but O
nothing O
really O
worked O
long O
term O
. O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
at O
14 O
and O
I O
am O
23 O
now O
and O
basicly O
in O
a O
flare B-ADR
since O
3 O
years O
while O
trying O
to O
break O
them O
with O
prednisone B-DRUG
.. O
which O
also O
just O
helps O
me O
while O
beeing O
on O
a O
high O
dosage O
but O
its O
not O
suitable O
for O
long O
duration O
because O
I O
get O
like O
every O
single O
side O
effect O
possible O
from O
it O
. O



 O
Currently O
I O
begged O
my O
insurance O
to O
let O
me O
try O
Simponi B-DRUG
which O
they O
declined O
at O
first O
. O

Then O
I O
tried O
entering O
a O
study O
with O
a O
new O
biologikum O
where O
they O
did O
nt O
wanna O
have O
me O
since O
I O
already O
failed O
many O
pf O
them O
. O

After O
that O
I O
begged O
my O
insurance O
once O
again O
and O
they O
accepted O
my O
new O
medicine O
Simponi B-DRUG
. O



 O
So O
now O
I O
am O
in O
week O
6 O
of O
Simponi B-DRUG
with O
no O
signs O
of O
anything O
getting O
better O
and O
I O
feel O
just O
so O
defeated O
and O
do O
nt O
really O
know O
any O
way O
out O
to O
be O
honest O
. O



 O
But O
yeah O
saying O
all O
that O
, O
you O
still O
have O
some O
more O
ways O
to O
go O
on O
your O
therapy O
and O
I O
wish O
you O
all O
the O
best O
. O


My O
step O
dad O
called O
me O
a O
drug O
addict O
because O
i O
take O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
" O
his O
sister O
controls O
her O
IBS B-ADR
with O
diet O
and O
exercise O
. O

" O
I O
ve O
had O
numerous O
acquaintances O
tell O
me O
I O
just O
need O
to O
use O
cannabis B-DRUG
or O
essential O
oils O
to O
get O
off O
my O
prescriptions O
meds O
. O

I O
already O
spend O
$ O
400 O
on O
cannabis B-DRUG
a O
month O
and O
many O
of O
these O
people O
know O
that O
, O
which O
makes O
it O
extra O
absurd O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
talk O
to O
these O
people O
anymore O
. O


I O
regularly O
get O
the O
headache B-ADR
the O
day O
after O
injecting O
, O
but O
not O
the O
flu B-ADR
like I-ADR
symptoms I-ADR
. O



 O
It O
may O
be O
just O
a O
cold O
? O



 O
I O
find O
injecting O
in O
the O
early O
morning O
helps O
. O



 O
I O
've O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
10 O
years O
, O
not O
had O
the O
flu B-ADR
like I-ADR
symptoms I-ADR
. O



 O
Drink O
plenty O
of O
fluids O
. O



 O
All O
the O
best O
. O


Thanks O
for O
the O
reply O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
'm O
squeamish O
about O
rare O
meats O
, O
good O
to O
know O
that O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
n't O
affecting O
you O
enough O
that O
you O
ca O
n't O
eat O
them O
. O

I O
'll O
be O
sure O
to O
treat O
cuts O
anyway O
. O

Concern O
I O
had O
is O
I O
sometimes O
do O
n't O
notice O
I O
have O
cuts O
on O
my O
hand O
until O
I O
use O
hand O
sanitizer O
. O

I O
then O
find O
them O
the O
painful B-ADR
way O

A O
normal O
colon O
looks O
like O
the O
reddish O
pink O
circles O
at O
the O
end O
of O
warners O
brothers O
cartoons O
, O
like O
the O
old O
porky O
pig O
stuff O
. O

   O
Crohn O
’s O
look O
like O
cobblestones O
and O
starts O
in O
one O
place O
and O
proceeds O
from O
that O
point O
. O

  O
Ulcerative B-ADR
colitis I-ADR
is O
multiple O
places O
that O
look O
like O
canker B-ADR
sores I-ADR
scattered O
along O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
colon O
. O

  O
Diverticula B-ADR
does O
look O
like O
little O
teardrop O
shaped O
pouching O
. O

  O
Avoid O
eating O
popcorn O
, O
sunflower O
seeds O
, O
and O
corn O
if O
you O
have O
this O
condition O
. O

  O
They O
can O
get O
stuck O
in O
those O
butt O
hidey O
holes O
and O
cause O
inflammation B-ADR
and O
infection B-ADR
. O

  O
It O
can O
even O
kill B-ADR
people O
. O

  O
I O
’m O
sorry O
you O
have O
Crohns O
. O

  O
Please O
eat O
a O
high O
iron O
diet O
and O
monitor O
yourself O
for O
signs O
of O
anemia B-ADR
such O
as O
fatigue B-ADR
and O
watch O
your O
stools O
for O
warnings O
of O
bleeding B-ADR
. O

   O
Drugs O
like O
humira B-DRUG
have O
been O
a O
game O
changer O
for O
many O
people O
. O

Edit O
word O
then O
again O
edit O

First O
started O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
but O
I O
was O
allergic B-ADR
to O
it O
. O

Second O
was O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
which O
worked O
for O
about O
a O
year O
, O
but O
then O
my O
plaque B-ADR
Psoriasis I-ADR
started O
coming O
back O
so O
after O
18 O
months O
I O
switched O
to O
Stelara B-DRUG
which O
has O
been O
working O
great O
for O
the O
last O
2.5 O
years O
. O


So O
my O
GI O
thinks O
my O
Ferritin O
( O
also O
low O
) O
and O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
should O
improve O
now O
that O
I O
'm O
only O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
not O
Mercaptopurine B-DRUG
so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
check O
again O
next O
month O
and O
see O
if O
there O
's O
improvement O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
seen O
as O
much O
improvement O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
as O
I O
would O
like O
( O
I O
'm O
about O
5 O
months O
into O
it O
) O
so O
I O
may O
start O
weekly O
injections O
or O
just O
try O
something O
new O
altogether O
. O


Oh O
wow O
I O
did O
n’t O
realise O
we O
had O
that O
in O
NZ O
. O

I O
just O
swapped O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
and O
have O
a O
5 O
week O
loading O
phase O
of O
weekly O
injections O
and O
did O
my O
injection O
in O
the O
morning O
by O
afternoon O
I O
had O
sore B-ADR
throat I-ADR
and O
tested O
positive O
. O

I O
’m O
only O
3 O
weeks O
in O
so O
I O
’m O
hoping O
I O
do O
n’t O
need O
to O
stop O
and O
will O
be O
fine O
by O
Tuesday O
! O


Good O
to O
know O
. O

In O
the O
past O
I O
failed O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
, O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Cimzia B-DRUG
. O

Doc O
wants O
me O
on O
Stelara B-DRUG
but O
I O
found O
out O
the O
odds O
of O
Stelara B-DRUG
keeping O
me O
in O
remission O
up O
to O
a O
year O
were O
less O
than O
15 O
% O
so O
I O
did O
n’t O
go O
for O
it O
. O

I O
see O
Skyrizi B-DRUG
was O
just O
approved O
for O
Crohn O
’s O
maybe O
it O
’s O
an O
option O
for O
me O
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
sort O
of O
controlling O
the O
Crohn O
’s O
with O
diet O
and O
low O
dose O
naltrexone O
but O
not O
100 O
% O
. O


Yes O
, O
that O
's O
how O
he O
is O
too O
. O

Feeling O
trapped O
or O
like O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
access O
to O
the O
bathroom O
turns O
into O
an O
immediate O
' O
got O
ta O
poop O
! O

' O


 O
We O
also O
share O
the O
same O
GI O
and O
he O
jokes O
that O
we O
" O
travel O
in O
a O

we O
usually O
book O
back O

 O
My O
spouse O
also O
went O
through O
a O
prolonged O
phase O
of O
not O
taking O
meds O
after O
he O
got O
diagnosed O
. O

Do O

you O
just O
want O
to O

Ugh O

He O
almost O
died O
from O
sepsis B-ADR
, O
had O
a O
contained O
perforation O
, O
his O
body O
straight O
up O
dissolved O
his O
appendix O
, O
and O
he O
ended O
up O
having O
about O
a O
foot O
of O
his O
large O
intestine O
taken O
out O
. O

That O
was O
his O
biggest O
surgery O
but O
he O
's O
had O
tons O
of O
I&Ds O
for O
abscesses B-ADR
and O
fistulas O
. O

He O
went O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
post O
op O
and O
has O
been O
doing O
really O
, O
really O
well O
. O

I O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
I O
've O
been O
pretty O
envious O
of O
how O
simple O
it O
was O
for O
him O
to O
find O
a O
biologic O
that O
works O
, O
it O
set O
me O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
I O
'd O
be O
fine O
once O
I O
started O
a O
biologic O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
working O
on O
my O
sixth O
surgery O
since O
2020 O
but O
thankfully O
none O
were O
resections O
. O

I O
'm O
also O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG
and O
it O
's O
working O
somewhat O
. O

I O
hope O
your O
remission O
continues O
and O
that O
you O
remain O
surgery O
free O
! O


I O
had O
sever O
rheumatoid B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
( O
poly O
) O
and O
had O
takem O
methrotexat B-DRUG
for O
many O
years O
without O
succes O
. O

Then O
humira B-DRUG
came O
to O
my O
therapie O
and O
since O
then O
i O
can O
live O
like O
a O
functional O
and O
healthy O
human O
being(5years O
taking O
it O
now O
) O
. O

At O
the O
start O
i O
had O
two O
infections B-ADR
but O
nothing O
more O
after O
that O
. O


How O
long O
since O
you O
started O
the O
humira B-DRUG
? O

I O
am O
starting O
soon O
and O
am O
so O
hopeful O
🤞 O

Humira B-DRUG
3 O
years O
strong O

I O
was O
first O
diagnosed O
with O
RA O
until O
an O
MRI O
of O
my O
pelvis O
revealed O
unilateral O
inflammation B-ADR
and O
not O
bilateral O
inflammation B-ADR
( O
as O
another O
poster O
said O
, O
RA O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
symmetric O
) O
. O

Combined O
with O
lower B-ADR
back I-ADR
pain I-ADR
a O
few O
other O
interesting O
signs O
related O
to O
tendon O
inflammation B-ADR
with O
what O
seemed O
to O
be O
RA O
symptoms O
, O
and O
now O
my O
diagnosis O
moved O
to O
undifferentiated O
spondylioarthropathy O
. O

My O
treatment O
plan O
has O
basically O
stayed O
what O
it O
would O
have O
been O
with O
my O
seronegative O
RA O
diagnosis O
, O
so O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Hopefully O
this O
helps O
give O
some O
perspective O
- O
and O
I O
’m O
glad O
your O
new O
doctor O
is O
considering O
all O
possibilities O
. O


There O
’s O
a O
website O
, O
I O
think O
it O
’s O
https://www.completerebate.com O
where O
you O
submit O
any O
out O
of O
pocket O
amounts O
you O
paid O
for O
the O
drug O
and O
Humira B-DRUG
will O
refund O
you O
those O
minus O
the O
5 O
dollars O
copay O
to O
your O
bank O
account O
. O

I O
’ve O
used O
it O
before O
. O

A O
Humira B-DRUG
ambassador O
told O
me O
about O
it O
. O



 O
If O
you O
’re O
not O
sure O
, O
call O
your O
Humira B-DRUG
ambassador O
and O
ask O
about O
this O

Stage O

here O

low O

, O
CLn O
wash O
( O

most O
of O

are O
in O
the O
groin O

I O
also O

) O
, O
Caldesene O
Medicated O
powder O
along O
with O
humira B-DRUG
and O
spironolactone B-DRUG
have O
worked O
wonders O
together O
. O

The O
greatest O
improvement O
was O
when O
I O
added O
the O
powder O
to O
keep O
things O
dry O
. O


Thanks O
. O

I O
'm O
back O
to O
rheumatology O
in O
3 O
months O
. O

I O
've O
agree O
to O
take O
it O
until O
then O
, O
unless O
I O
'm O
unable O
to O
due O
to O
extreme O
side O
effects O
. O

We O
will O
decide O
then O
if O
we O
need O
to O
increase O
the O
dose O
, O
I O
'm O
starting O
with O
10 O
mg O
. O

I O
inject O
Humira B-DRUG
weekly O
and O
I O
'm O
hopeful O
I O
can O
remain O
on O
it O
as O
I O
have O
no O
side O
effects O
. O



 O
I O
did O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
previously O
, O
no O
side O
effects O
but O
also O
did O
nothing O
for O
me O
. O


I O
'm O
24 O
. O



 O
Was O
diagnosed O
in O
November O
, O
was O
dealing O
with O
psoriasis B-ADR
that O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
suborrheic B-ADR
dermatitis I-ADR
until O
arthritis B-ADR
started O
. O

Joints O
started O
to O
get O
swollen B-ADR
and O
had O
nail B-ADR
pitting I-ADR
. O

X O
- O
rays O
and O
blood O
tests O
were O
also O
clear O
( O
aside O
from O
a O
slightly O
elevated B-ADR
ANA I-ADR
count O
) O
. O



 O
My O
rheum O
said O
psoriatic B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
and O
got O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
   O
derm O
for O
a O
new O
psoriasis B-ADR
diagnosis O
. O



 O
Started O
methotrexate B-DRUG
which O
worked O
well O
. O

No O
side O
effects O
except O
for O
sleeping O
in O
a O
lot O
the O
next O
day O
. O

Joints O
are O
still O
swollen B-ADR
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
noticeable O
unless O
you O
look O
for O
it O
and O
my O
nails O
still O
have O
small O
pits B-ADR
. O

But O
it O
worked O
really O
well O
, O
took O
most O
of O
my O
symptoms O
away O
and O
helped O
a O
lot O
with O
the O
psoriasis B-ADR
. O



 O
Sadly O
looks O
like O
it O
's O
making O
my O
liver O
readings O
act O
up O
, O
so O
might O
move O
on O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O



 O
I O
've O
read O
some O
others O
who O
get O
eye B-ADR
issues I-ADR
, O
I O
would O
definitely O
bring O
this O
up O
with O
the O
rheumatologist O
. O


Thank O
you O
for O
your O
kind O
reply O
<3 O
i O
’m O
truly O
happy O
for O
you O
that O
you O
got O
over O
your O
own O
disease O
! O



 O
I O
am O
diagnosed O
with O
ankylosing O
spondyloarthritis O
, O
I O
also O
have O
mysterious O
knee B-ADR
issues I-ADR
that O
caused O
me O
a O
severe O
arthritis B-ADR
even O
my O
surgeon O
does O
n’t O
understand O
. O

I O
now O
take O
Humira B-DRUG
( O
immunosupressant O
) O
shots O
every O
week O
, O
weirdly O
it O
helped O
my O
knee O
but O
not O
my O
back O
which O
is O
still O
awful O
. O

My O
SI O
joint B-ADR
hurts I-ADR
like O
crazy O
and O
I O
am O
taking O
opiates O
every O
day O
. O



 O
I O
gladly O
take O
your O
advice O
if O
you O
have O
some O
. O


Thank O
you O
again O
for O
your O
comment O
! O

<3 O

Glad O
it O
's O
working O
. O

My O
symptoms O
really O
came O
on O
in O
Feb O
, O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
very O
strict O
diet O
. O

Sounds O
like O
what O
you O
did O
, O
except O
no O
dairy O
also O
. O

I O
lost O
weight O
. O

Did O
nothing O
for O
the O
PSA O
. O



 O
Humira B-DRUG
was O
amazing O
, O
but O
seemed O
to O
wear O
off O
after O
6 O
months O
or O
so O
. O

Now O
switching O
meds O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
few O
weeks O
out O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
symptoms B-ADR
are I-ADR
coming I-ADR
back I-ADR
. O


I O
think O
it O
’s O
different O
for O
each O
person O
. O

You O
might O
try O
contacting O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
hotline O
to O
talk O
to O
one O
of O
their O
nurses O
and O
see O
what O
they O
say O
. O

Maybe O
this O
is O
just O
an O
initial O
reaction B-ADR
and O
your O
body O
will O
adjust O
to O
the O
medication O
over O
time O
. O

FWIW O
I O
developed O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
trying O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
stayed O
with O
me O
until O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
( O
since O
it O
was O
n’t O
working O
anyway O
) O
. O


Just O
to O
be O
clear O
, O
have O
you O
talked O
to O
your O
doctor O
yet O
about O
whether O
you O
actually O
qualify O
for O
biologics O
? O

This O
depends O
on O
both O
your O
doctor O
— O
they O
will O
judge O
whether O
they O
think O
your O
are O
eligible O
based O
on O
factors O
such O
as O
the O
amount O
of O
skin O
coverage O
you O
have O
, O
how O
it O
's O
affecting O
your O
quality O
of O
life O
, O
and O
so O
on O

have O

 O
Usually O
biologics O

they O
come O
with O

as O
well O
as O
the O
two O
new O
non O
- O
steroid O
medications O
that O
came O
out O
this O
year O
, O
Vtama B-DRUG
and O
Zoryve B-DRUG
. O



 O
Also O
worth O
asking O
: O
Have O
you O
also O
used O
antifungals O
? O

Inverse O
and O
fungal B-ADR
infections I-ADR
go O
hand O
in O
hand O
( O
because O
of O
the O
moist O
environment O
, O
but O
also O
psoriasis B-ADR
itself O
causes O
a O
dysregulation O
of O
the O
skin O
barrier O
, O
even O
in O
non O
- O
lesional O
skin O
) O
. O

Since O
topicals O
used O
on O
inverse O
( O
Protopic B-DRUG
etc O
. O

) O
are O
immunosuppressive O
, O
they O
can O
actually O
make O
the O
fungal B-ADR
infection I-ADR
worse O
. O

So O
inverse O
is O
generally O
also O
treated O
with O
antifungal O
creams O
like O
ketoconazole B-DRUG
. O


Just O
so O
you O
know O
, O
both O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Remicade B-DRUG
are O
biologics O
. O

They O
are O
different O
in O
the O
ways O
they O
target O
the O
immune O
system O
and O
the O
delivery O
method O
is O
different O
, O
but O
still O
the O
same O
category O
. O

There O
are O
also O
several O
biologics O
that O
are O
a O
daily O
pill O
, O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
are O
approved O
widely O
for O
HS O
. O



 O
I O
have O
RA O
, O
HS O
, O
and O
t2 O
diabetes B-ADR
so O
my O
treatment O
plan O
is O
complicated O
. O

My O
dermatologist O
has O
been O
the O
primary O
for O
my O
HS O
, O
and O
primarily O
has O
me O
using O
topical O
methods O
to O
calm O
attacks O
before O
they O
erupt O
, O
and O
an O
antibiotic O
to O
calm O
the O
immune O
system O
. O

Because O
I O
ca O
n't O
take O
a O
biologic O
with O
an O
open O
abcess O
, O
we O
try O
to O
prevent O
eruption B-ADR
and O
draining B-ADR
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O

I O
am O
coming O
out O
of O
a O
bad O
flare B-ADR
that O
has O
been O
complicated O
by O
the O
slow O
healing O
from O
diabetes B-ADR
. O

Been O
trying O
to O
heal O
these O
spots O
since O
September O
! O



 O
As O
for O
the O
specific O
meds O
, O
I O
have O
taken O
both O
for O
the O
RA O
( O
so O
unsure O
how O
the O
dosage O
is O
different O
) O
. O

I O
  O
always O
felt O
exhausted B-ADR
an O
hour O
or O
two O
after O
an O
infusion O
, O
and O
it O
usually O
lasted O
most O
of O
the O
day O
. O

On O
the O
plus O
side O
, O
my O
medical O
insurance O
covered O
the O
infusions O
better O
than O
my O
prescription O
insurance O
covered O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

So O
much O
so O
, O
that O
if O
the O
med O
was O
available O
both O
ways O
, O
I O
opted O
for O
the O
infusion O
. O


I O
've O
had O
multiple O
surgeries O
and O
have O
almost O
died B-ADR
because O
  O
I O
stopped O
taking O
humira B-DRUG
after O
I O
was O
in O
remission O
.. O
never O
in O
my O
life O
will O
I O
go O
without O
meds O
if O
I O
can O
help O
it O

Thanks O
I O
'm O
looking O
into O
humira B-DRUG
right O
now O
I O
'll O
bring O
it O
up O
with O
them O

Oh O
my O
gosh O
, O
that O
sounds O
so O
stressful O
, O
I O
’m O
so O
sorry O
! O

💕 O
Do O
you O
have O
a O
PCP O
you O
can O
see O
until O
you O
find O
one O
, O
just O
so O
you O
have O
someone O
to O
talk O
through O
things O
with O
? O



 O
I O
was O
on O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
for O
years O
, O
but O
since O
there O
’s O
still O
not O
enough O
pregnancy O
data O
, O
my O
rheum O
had O
me O
switch O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

There O
was O
another O
biologic O
that O
was O
an O
option O
, O
but O
we O
decided O
Humira B-DRUG
was O
best O
because O
I O
was O
more O
likely O
to O
take O
it O
with O
the O
pen O
than O
the O
syringe O
the O
other O
one O
had O
. O

I O
was O
worried O
because O
I O
had O
a O
really O
bad O
reaction B-ADR
to O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
but O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
been O
completely O
different O
! O


I O
have O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
7 O
months O
and O
have O
had O
no O
side O
effects O
at O
all O
except O
for O
one O
injection B-ADR
site I-ADR
reaction I-ADR
which O
was O
easily O
taken O
care O
of O
with O
hydrocortisone B-DRUG
cream O
. O

It O
has O
made O
such O
an O
improvement O
in O
my O
life O
! O

I O
would O
say O
I O
’m O
at O
least O
85 O
- O
90 O
% O
better O
than O
I O
was O
at O
my O
worst O
. O

Best O
of O
luck O
to O
you O
🤍 O

Most O
of O
it O
is O
covered O
by O
insurance O
. O

Even O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
one O
of O
the O
best O
selling O
patented O
drugs O
in O
the O
last O
year O
cost O
more O
then O
90,000 O
$ O
per O
year O
. O

Asking O
this O
much O
is O
no O
surprise O
, O
especially O
when O
it O
’s O
the O
only O
one O
on O
the O
market O
. O


I O
had O
that O
lifting O
of O
the O
nail O
, O
where O
I O
’d O
get O
these O
strange O
white O
spots O
from O
where O
the O
nails O
had O
lifted O
off O
my O
finger O
, O
and O
would O
grow O
out O
wavy O
. O

  O
I O
also O
had O
the O
ridging O
. O

  O
Once O
i O
went O
onto O
Humira B-DRUG
the O
lifting O
of O
the O
fingernails O
went O
away O
, O
i O
still O
have O
some O
of O
the O
ridging O
, O
but O
not O
as O
bad O
. O

  O
I O
have O
PSA O
, O
so O
yea O
, O
definitely O
this O
is O
similar O
to O
what O
i O
had O
, O
and O
a O
biologic O
certainly O
helped O
with O
that O
( O
and O
my O
psoriasis B-ADR
is O
completely O
gone O
, O
and O
my O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
is O
MAINLY O
gone O
too O
, O
but O
not O
100 O
% O

You O
did O
say O
or O
imply O
you O
were O
using O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
savings O
card O
to O
get O
that O
$ O
5 O
copay O
, O
right O
? O

If O
that O
's O
not O
what O
you O
meant O
by O
" O
savings O
plan O
, O
" O
that O
's O
an O
option O
. O

There O
's O
also O
the O
MyAbbVie O
Assist O
program O
, O
which O
you O
can O
apply O
to O
get O
free O
Humira B-DRUG
if O
your O
insurance O
wo O
n't O
pay O
for O
it O
at O
all O
or O
you O
have O
some O
other O
financial O
difficulty O
. O


I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
barely O
a O
month O
for O
both O
HS O
and O
Psoriasis B-ADR
… O
did O
almost O
nothing O
for O
HS O
but O
made O
by O
psoriasis B-ADR
10 O
times O
worse O
, O
yay O
/s O

I O
’d O
see O
if O
there O
is O
another O
injectable O
option O
from O
first O
, O
an O
IV O
sounds O
very O
inconvenient O
when O
it O
’s O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O


Not O
sure O
what O
they O
would O
prescribe O
him O
, O
but O
some O
medications O
like O
humira B-DRUG
have O
the O
option O
to O
come O
in O
a O
pen O
instead O
of O
a O
syringe O
. O

Those O
pens O
have O
nice O
little O
covers O
that O
block O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
needle O
the O
whole O
time O
, O
almost O
like O
a O
neat O
little O
tube O
to O
keep O
it O
hidden O
. O

I O
’ve O
never O
seen O
the O
needle O
when O
injecting O
myself O
and O
currently O
only O
have O
to O
do O
it O
once O
every O
two O
weeks O
. O

Takes O
less O
than O
a O
minute O
or O
so O
every O
time O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
that O
might O
help O
, O
but O
I O
always O
do O
better O
w O
needles O
when O
I O
ca O
n’t O
see O
it O
. O

The O
pen O
is O
as O
easy O
of O
a O
process O
as O
they O
can O
make O
it O
, O
imho O
, O
so O
if O
he O
has O
to O
go O
on O
a O
biologic O
I O
’d O
look O
into O
using O
that O
form O
over O
a O
traditional O
syringe O
! O


Before O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
I O
had O
severe O
abdominal B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

Before O
that O
, O
I O
also O
had O
loose B-ADR
stool I-ADR
/ O
diarrhea B-ADR
. O

If O
I O
remember O
correctly O
, O
I O
would O
have O
a O
loose B-ADR
stool I-ADR
about O
once O
a O
week O
. O

Since O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
multiple O
stools O
per O
day O
, O
the O
doctor O
told O
me O
that O
I O
should O
n't O
be O
concerned O
. O

I O
think O
he O
was O
wrong O
. O

If O
I O
would O
have O
gone O
to O
a O
gastroenterologist O
earlier O
and O
gotten O
a O
colonoscopy O
, O
perhaps O
I O
could O
have O
avoided O
surgery O
. O

For O
the O
last O
twenty O
years O
I O
have O
used O
mesalamine B-DRUG
, O
probiotics O
, O
antibiotics O
, O
supplements O
and O
lately O
humira B-DRUG
. O

Good O
luck O
to O
you O
! O


I O
tried O
cosentryx O
after O
having O
a O
side O
effect O
from O
humira B-DRUG
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
humira B-DRUG
is O
top O
notch O
. O

Cosentyx B-DRUG
is O
good O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
help O
as O
much O
. O

I O
found O
my O
body O
still O
flaring O
up O
just O
not O
as O
frequent O
. O

Cosentyx B-DRUG
also O
lowers O
your O
immune O
system O
severely O
. O

I O
had O
a O
deroofing O
done O
and O
my O
surgeon O
told O
me O
to O
stop O
cosentyx B-DRUG
due O
to O
how O
much O
it O
impacts O
your O
healing O
and O
immune O
system O
if O
you O
were O
to O
even O
get O
a O
cold O
. O

My O
insurance O
put O
up O
a O
fight O
to O
cover O
it O
, O
as O
cosentyx B-DRUG
is O
mainly O
for O
plaque B-ADR
psoriasis I-ADR
. O

I O
'd O
say O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

Nothing O
bad O
about O
it O
, O
it O
just O
did O
n't O
heal O
my O
hs O
flares O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
continue O
it O
. O

Hope O
this O
helps O
. O


Humira- B-DRUG
that O
will O
be O
what O
got O
rid O
of O
your O
psoriasis B-ADR
because O
it O
suppresses O
the O
inflammation B-ADR
. O

It O
’s O
not O
to O
do O
with O
mold O

Comes O
and O
goes O
. O

I O
will O
be O
in O
far O
more O
pain B-ADR
with O
my O
joints O
than O
I O
am O
ever O
in O
with O
typical O
Crohn O
's O
symptoms O
and O
then O
poof O
, O
a O
few O
days O
up O
to O
a O
couple O
weeks O
later O
it O
's O
gone O
. O

  O
I O
have O
never O
been O
able O
to O
pin O
point O
a O
trigger O
. O

  O
Happens O
maybe O
2 O
- O
3 O
times O
a O
year O
. O



 O
Ankles O
, O
knees O
, O
hands O
( O
thumbs O
in O
particular O
are O
very O
bad O
right O
now O
) O
. O

  O
I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
10 O
years O
. O


Fun O
is O
n’t O
it O
? O

OA O
decided O
to O
join O
the O
party O
too O
with O
a O
plethora O
of O
bone B-ADR
spurs I-ADR
. O

Humira B-DRUG
is O
like O
Dunkin O
: O
keeps O
me O
going O
. O


You O
can O
talk O
to O
your O
dentist O
as O
well O
. O

Often O
times O
, O
dentists O
will O
be O
familiar O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
so O
you O
might O
just O
ask O
about O
a O
" O
Humira B-DRUG
like O
" O
medication O
. O


I O
think O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
their O
first O
option O
because O
of O
how O
well O
it O
usually O
works O
for O
anything O
inflammatory O
. O

For O
him O
though O
, O
his O
appetite O
has O
increased O
heavily O
and O
he O
does O
get O
what O
’s O
called O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
Hangover B-ADR
the O
next O
day O
from O
the O
shot O
. O

However O
, O
his O
lesions O
have O
pretty O
much O
stopped O
draining B-ADR
and O
the O
inflammation B-ADR
has O
gone O
down O
a O
lot O
. O

Still O
, O
they O
should O
have O
you O
do O
a O
metabolic O
table O
before O
getting O
you O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
just O
to O
be O
sure O
it O
’s O
safe O
for O
you O
to O
take O
. O


Thank O
you O
❤ O
️ O
I O
had O
to O
tell O
myself O
that O
when O
I O
stopped O
breastfeeding O
to O
start O
humira B-DRUG
with O
my O
first O
and O
I O
tried O
to O
remind O
myself O
she O
would O
n’t O
be O
mad O
at O
me O
down O
the O
road O
for O
not O
going O
an O
extra O
couple O
of O
months O
breastfeeding O
so O
that O
I O
could O
walk O
. O

I O
know O
it O
’s O
true O
but O
it O
’s O
hard O
to O
emotionally O
grapple O
with O
the O
possibility O
. O


I O
did O
this O
route O
and O
the O
nurse O
was O
helpful O
. O

She O
told O
me O
what O
to O
say O
and O
when O
. O

Now O
I O
’ll O
take O
a O
version O
or O
humira B-DRUG
, O
due O
to O
start O
anyway O
. O



 O
Also O
, O
your O
comments O
are O
the O
most O
helpful O
, O
very O
, O
very O
informative O
. O

Do O
n’t O
stop O
. O

The O
community O
needs O
you O
. O



 O
Can O
I O
ask O
where O
you O
are O
based O
? O


Oh O
my O
gosh O
! O

I O
'm O
on O
plaquenil B-DRUG
2x O
a O
day O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
it O
helps O
any O
. O

I O
also O
take O
gabapentin B-DRUG
3x O
a O
day O
so O
who O
knows O
. O


Does O
the O
humira B-DRUG
help O
with O
PR O
as O
well O
? O


Also O
you O
are O
a O
hell O
of O
a O
fighter O
. O


If O
I O
might O
give O
my O
2 O
cents O
… O
it O
sounds O
like O
your O
doctor O
and O
you O
do O
n’t O
have O
the O
best O
relationship O
, O
so O
I O
’d O
be O
careful O
when O
making O
your O
decision O
based O
on O
what O
they O
say O
. O

They O
might O
be O
patronizing O
or O
rude O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n’t O
mean O
they O
’re O
wrong O
or O
not O
giving O
you O
their O
best O
medical O
judgement O
. O

This O
is O
a O
really O
important O
decision O
, O
and O
both O
you O
and O
your O
doctor O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
all O
the O
risks O
( O
do O
you O
have O
other O
medical O
issues O
that O
make O
you O
more O
prone O
to O
infection B-ADR
? O

Could O
those O
be O
managed O
? O

) O
and O
potential O
consequences O
( O
for O
example O
, O
being O
unable O
to O
do O
your O
activities O
even O
if O
you O
do O
n’t O
go O
on O
the O
drug O
because O
the O
disease O
is O
allowed O
to O
progress O
) O
. O

You O
can O
also O
start O
humira B-DRUG
and O
stop O
later O
if O
you O
get O
sick B-ADR
a O
bunch O
. O

Best O
of O
luck O
on O
your O
journey O
:) O

Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
was O
resistant O
to O
it O
for O
a O
while O
but O
psoriasis B-ADR
affected O
everything O
in O
my O
life O
. O

Been O
on O
it O
for O
3 O
years O
now O
. O

We O
’ll O
see O

I O
was O
on O
Enbrel B-DRUG
which O
was O
fantastic O
until O
I O
took O
3 O
weeks O
off O
to O
get O
a O
Covid O
shot O
. O

It O
gave O
my O
body O
time O
to O
apparently O
build O
up O
antibodies O
to O
all O
TNF O
blockers O
( O
since O
after O
Enbrel B-DRUG
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
my O
doctor O
tired O
Humira B-DRUG
which O
did O
nothing O
also O
) O
. O

I O
'm O
now O
on O
Orencia B-DRUG
which O
works O
pretty O
well O
. O

I O
do O
like O
that O
Orencia B-DRUG
has O
no O
FDA O
black O
box O
warning O
compared O
to O
Enbrel B-DRUG
and O
Humira B-DRUG
. O


I O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
feeling O
. O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
at O
19 O
had O
a O
very O
rough O
time O
until O
my O
first O
resection O
. O

I O
thought O
no O
pain B-ADR
, O
no O
need O
for O
meds O
. O

It O
did O
n’t O
work O
. O

15 O
years O
later O
my O
crohns O
is O
acting O
up O
. O

I O
was O
sent O
by O
my O
GI O
to O
another O
GI O
re O
biologics O
. O

I O
said O
know O
due O
to O
cost O
and O
my O
perception O
of O
the O
risks O
. O

I O
suffered O
for O
8 O
years O
or O
so O
until O
I O
relented O
to O
go O
on O
humira B-DRUG
. O

It O
did O
n’t O
stop O
my O
next O
resection O
as O
my O
crohns O
kept O
doing O
more O
damage O
so O
I O
had O
to O
have O
a O
second O
resection O
. O

It O
ended O
up O
being O
a O
very O
long O
surgery O
, O
6~7 O
hours O
. O

My O
spouse O
did O
n’t O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on O
as O
she O
dropped O
me O
off O
at O
6 O
am O
and O
did O
n’t O
get O
to O
see O
me O
till O
7 O
pm O
. O

  O
I O
stayed O
on O
humira B-DRUG
. O

It O
is O
now O
12 O
years O
later O
and O
I O
am O
still O
in O
remission O
. O



 O
Crohns O
can O
do O
damage O
you O
do O
n’t O
see O
. O

We O
do O
n’t O
all O
react O
the O
same O
. O

I O
dealt O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
pain B-ADR
over O
my O
years O
. O

The O
stretch O
of O
time O
before O
my O
second O
surgery O
was O
just O
constant O
pain B-ADR
but O
I O
learned O
to O
block O
it O
. O

  O
A O
few O
days O
after O
my O
second O
resection O
I O
woke O
up O
and O
realized O
something O
odd O
. O

There O
was O
no O
pain B-ADR
. O

I O
felt O
the O
pain B-ADR
so O
long O
I O
was O
just O
numb B-ADR
to O
it O
. O

This O
can O
be O
a O
very O
hard O
disease O
to O
deal O
with O
. O

Work O
with O
your O
doctor O
to O
make O
the O
right O
choices O
. O

Take O
care O
. O


If O
its O
an O
immunosuppressant O
that O
targets O
T O
- O
Cells O
, O
the O
Drug O
is O
Adalumimab B-DRUG
or O
Humira B-DRUG
. O



 O
It O
also O
treats O
artheritis B-ADR
, O
Chrons O
/ O
Colitis B-ADR
etc O
. O


It O
's O
a O
very O
common O
side O
effect O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
it O
's O
biosimilars O
. O

You O
'll O
see O
it O
mentioned O
here O
often O
. O



 O
I O
take O
it O
in O
the O
evening O
to O
get O
over O
the O
initial O
effects O
overnight O
, O
and O
then O
I O
'll O
have O
1 O
- O
4 O
days O
of O
general O
tired B-ADR
and O
  O
crappy B-ADR
afterwards O
. O

I O
've O
always O
had O
it O
like O
this O
and O
it O
's O
happened O
with O
every O
injection O
in O
13 O
years O
. O


Yeah O
… O
pentasa B-DRUG
is O
cheap O
compared O
to O
the O
biologics O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
they O
’re O
available O
where O
you O
live O
but O
they O
are O
insanely O
expensive O
in O
America O
. O

I O
was O
on O
stelara B-DRUG
and O
the O
drug O
company O
charged O
my O
insurance O
something O
like O
$ O
20k O
or O
more O
for O
one O
8 O
week O
injection O
. O

The O
drug O
companies O
have O
payment O
assistance O
programs O
that O
cover O
varying O
amounts O
so O
I O
only O
paid O
like O
$ O
5 O
. O

Now O
I O
’m O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
the O
base O
cost O
to O
insurance O
is O
6k O
per O
month O
. O

I O
pay O
$ O
5 O
until O
I O
meet O
my O
out O
of O
pocket O
max O
then O
it O
’s O
free O
. O

Out O
of O
pocket O
max O
is O
the O
limit O
on O
how O
much O
total O
you O
can O
pay O
before O
insurance O
has O
to O
cover O
the O
rest O
for O
the O
calendar O
year O
. O

But O
the O
cost O
is O
n’t O
the O
only O
issue O
in O
America O
… O
I O
feel O
grateful O
to O
be O
in O
a O
country O
where O
biologics O
are O
available O
but O
I O
am O
also O
deeply O
disappointed O
with O
how O
disabled O
and O
chronically O
ill O
people O
have O
to O
fight O
for O
basic O
rights O
here O
. O

Insurance O
is O
a O
necessary O
evil O
. O

They O
do O
n’t O
care O
about O
you O
, O
they O
care O
about O
saving O
money O
at O
all O
costs O
and O
the O
law O
barely O
protects O
us O
. O

But O
if O
you O
do O
n’t O
have O
insurance O
at O
all O
, O
that O
’s O
another O
level O
of O
struggle O
. O

TLDR O
it O
sucks O
. O

$ O
140 O
is O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
money O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in O
America O
but O
it O
is O
just O
scratching O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
issue O
unfortunately O

I O
've O
had O
issues O
since O
I O
was O
7 O
. O

28 O
now O
and O
finally O
diagnosed O
this O
year O
with O
PDR O
and O
fibromyalgia B-ADR
. O

Started O
with O
lyme B-ADR
disease I-ADR
at O
7 O
and O
countless O
years O
of O
drs O
to O
finally O
find O
good O
ones O
in O
a O
new O
state O
. O

Just O
started O
plaquenil B-DRUG
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
and O
humira B-DRUG
2 O
weeks O
ago O
for O
HS O
( O
inflammatory O
skin O
condition O
) O
. O


I O
've O
heard O
so O
many O
people O
saying O
that O
dietary O
changes O
make O
so O
little O
impact O
that O
I O
've O
personally O
never O
restricted O
myself O
from O
certain O
things O
, O
  O
though O
I O
have O
been O
doing O
intermittent O
fasting O
mostly O
as O
a O
way O
to O
get O
my O
weight O
under O
control O
. O


As O
far O
as O
my O
Psa O
goes O
, O
tanning O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
humira B-DRUG
is O
pretty O
much O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
helps O
. O

  O
Prednisone B-DRUG
during O
flares B-ADR
. O


I O
took O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
several O
years O
and O
never O
experienced O
any O
side O
effects O
other O
than O
occasional O
bruising B-ADR
at O
the O
injection O
site O
. O

It O
does O
lower O
your O
immune O
system O
, O
but O
not O
greatly O
. O

I O
worked O
at O
a O
daycare O
( O
so O
* O
tons O
* O
of O
germs O
) O
and O
did O
n't O
get O
sick B-ADR
any O
more O
often O
than O
usual O
. O


How O
much O
is O
the O
generic O
though O
? O

With O
the O
copay O
card O
I O
pay O
$ O
5 O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Which O
is O
what O
makes O
it O
obvious O
it O
’s O
a O
scam O
. O

But O
if O
I O
were O
to O
get O
switched O
to O
the O
generic O
would O
I O
have O
to O
pay O
more O
because O
I O
wo O
n’t O
have O
the O
card O
anymore O
? O


I O
’m O
a O
steroid O
responder O
too O
, O
was O
on O
steroid O
drops O
for O
two O
years O
and O
then O
managed O
to O
move O
onto O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
also O
had O
to O
have O
glaucoma B-ADR
surgeries O
in O
both O
eyes O
and O
cataract B-ADR
surgery O
from O
the O
drops O
. O



 O
I O
’ve O
found O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
be O
great O
. O

I O
was O
lucky O
because O
I O
had O
a O
really O
bad O
reaction B-ADR
to O
a O
“ O
lesser O
” O
immunosuppressant O
so O
managed O
to O
get O
onto O
Humira B-DRUG
pretty O
easily O
. O

I O
have O
n’t O
really O
had O
any O
side O
effects O
apart O
from O
more O
easily O
getting O
mild O
colds O
etc O
. O


I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
years O
. O

  O
I O
have O
to O
watch O
what O
I O
eat O
or O
I O
'll O
flare B-ADR
up I-ADR
, O
but O
otherwise O
it O
does O
the O
job O
. O

  O
Hope O
you O
're O
feeling O
better O
soon O

Enteropathic B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
is O
an O
inflammatory B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
for O
folks O
who O
have O
IBD B-ADR
. O

For O
me O
, O
my O
knee O
blew O
up O
over O
night O
with O
fluid O
and O
it O
miraculously O
went O
away O
over O
the O
course O
of O
10 O
days O
or O
so O
. O

My O
Crohn O
’s O
is O
in O
remission O
too O
, O
also O
on O
humira B-DRUG
. O

To O
dx O
it O
we O
had O
to O
take O
the O
synovial O
fluid O
from O
my O
knee O
. O

  O
The O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
was O
through O
the O
roof O
. O

Biological O
May O
can O
help O
but O
you O
may O
need O
something O
in O
conjunction O
like O
methotrexate B-DRUG
. O

Good O
luck O
! O


The O
mri O
was O
before O
the O
swap O
to O
rinvoq B-DRUG
, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
inflammation B-ADR
with O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Sorry O
for O
poor O
wording O

Yes O
, O
I O
also O
have O
ulcerative B-ADR
colitis I-ADR
. O

It O
is O
under O
control O
now O
, O
but O
is O
definitely O
affected O
when O
my O
AS O
flares B-ADR
up I-ADR
. O

So O
technically O
not O
under O
control O
I O
guess O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
will O
treat O
both O
. O


Thanks O
! O


No O
problem O
. O

:) O


 O
Cromolyn B-DRUG
sodium I-DRUG
has O
helped O
me O
tremendously O
, O
and O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
also O
doing O
a O
great O
job O
of O
reducing O
my O
pain B-ADR
and O
inflammation B-ADR
. O



 O
I O
ca O
n’t O
take O
anything O
specifically O
for O
the O
pain B-ADR
due O
to O
my O
allergies B-ADR
and O
liver O
and O
GI O
conditions O
. O

So O
far O
I O
’ve O
only O
actually O
fainted O
from O
arthritis B-ADR
pain B-ADR
once O
. O


I O
had O
an O
allergic B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
er O
for O
epinephrine B-DRUG
injection O
& O
breathing O
treatment O

I O
’m O
due O
to O
be O
starting O
Humira B-DRUG
next O
week O
and O
this O
was O
a O
relief O
to O
read O
. O

Well O
done O
and O
hope O
the O
treatment O
works O
well O
for O
you O

The O
thing O
I O
would O
not O
do O
is O
keep O
chickens O
. O

  O
I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
when O
I O
got O
disseminated B-ADR
histoplasmosis I-ADR
. O

  O
Histo O
is O
endemic O
in O
Arkansas O
, O
and O
my O
ID O
doc O
thought O
I O
just O
had O
an O
awakening O
of O
latent O
disease O
( O
immunocompetent O
hosts O
can O
handle O
exposure O
to O

, O
and O
everyone O
in O
Arkansas O
has O
been O
exposed O
) O
. O

  O
However O
, O
I O
clearly O
remember O
moving O
nesting O
material O

) O
in O
my O
chicken O
coop O
when O
a O
cloud O
of O
something O
( O
histo O
spores O
, O
no O
doubt O
) O
engulfed O
my O
head B-ADR
. O

  O
A O
few O
weeks O
later O
I O
had O
fever B-ADR
and O
was O
diagnosed O
two O
weeks O
later O
. O



 O
Humira B-DRUG
was O
a O
godsend O
for O
me O
. O

  O
But O
I O
can O
no O
longer O
take O
it O
having O
had O
two O
episodes O
of O
disseminated O
histo O
. O

  O
You O
can O
certainly O
take O
it O
safely O
. O

  O
Just O
avoid O
activities O
that O
would O
put O
you O
in O
contact O
with O
histoplasmosis B-ADR
and O
tuberculosis B-ADR
. O


Forgot O
to O
mention O
in O
my O
original O
post O
: O
I O
’ve O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
at O
this O
point O
twice O
a O
month O
for O
about O
nine O
months O
now O
. O

There O
was O
a O
break O
when O
I O
got O
Covid O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
break O
to O
“ O
experiment O
” O
. O

I O
’ve O
been O
back O
on O
it O
continuously O
since O
July O
while O
waiting O
for O
insurance O
to O
go O
through O
. O


I O
do O
n't O
get O
out O
much O
, O
I O
will O
try O
to O
when O
this O
flare B-ADR
calms O
down O
. O

But O
I O
have O
been O
instructed O
to O
avoid O
direct O
sunlight O
if O
i O
can O
, O
and O
to O
take O
a O
high O
dose O
of O
Vitamin O
D O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
which O
is O
kinda O
similar O
and O
that O
's O
what O
the O
nurse O
specialist O
told O
me O
when O
she O
showed O
me O
how O
the O
pens O
work O
. O



 O
Sunscreen O
works O
though O
, O
I O
use O
factor O
50 O
if O
I O
have O
to O
leave O
the O
house O
. O

You O
can O
still O
get O
high O
UV O
even O
if O
it O
is O
cloudy O
outside O
. O


Try O
to O
get O
on O
a O
wait O
list O
for O
your O
g.i O
. O

if O
anyone O
cancels O
you O
can O
get O
in O
sooner O
. O



 O
You O
may O
need O
something O
else O
like O
steroids B-DRUG
if O
you O
start O
flaring B-ADR
. O



 O
I O
was O
off O
humira B-DRUG
for O
a O
while O
one O
or O
two O
months O
i O
do O
nt O
remember O
. O

  O
I O
thought O
i O
had O
covid O
, O
it O
was O
just O
acid B-ADR
reflux I-ADR
. O

I O
even O
did O
the O
prometheus O
test O
. O

  O
I O
started O
back O
on O
it O
no O
problem O
. O

  O
I O
just O
had O
to O
do O
the O
loading O
doses O
again O
keep O
that O
in O
mind O
. O


Thank O
you O
for O
your O
kind O
words O
and O
encouragement O
. O

I O
was O
originally O
supposed O
to O
gradually O
up O
my O
spironolactone B-DRUG
dose O
to O
100 O
- O
150 O
mg O
but O
could O
not O
tolerate O
it O
at O
all O
to O
even O
get O
to O
that O
point O
. O

The O
side O
effects O
for O
me O
were O
wild O
, O
they O
basically O
did O
the O
opposite O
of O
what O
they O
should O
do O
: O
caused O
facial O
acne B-ADR
and O
hair B-ADR
loss I-ADR
on O
my O
head O
when O
they O
are O
prescribed O
to O
help O
both O
. O

My O
dermatologist O
could O
n't O
believe O
it O
and O
suggested O
it O
must O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
a O
traumatic O
event O
or O
something O
else O
, O
even O
though O
quite O
a O
few O
people O
have O
similar O
side O
effects O
. O

So O
bizarre O
. O



 O
I O
have O
never O
responded O
well O
to O
any O
hormonal O
meds O
( O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
pills O
were O
a O
nightmare B-ADR
and O
made O
my O
thyroid O
really O
sluggish B-ADR
) O
so O
it O
was O
n't O
surprising O
, O
but O
was O
so O
disappointing O
as O
I O
thought O
this O
drug O
would O
be O
my O
ticket O
to O
remission O
. O



 O
As O
far O
as O
Humira B-DRUG
goes O
, O
I O
am O
also O
not O
a O
candidate O
for O
it O
as O
I O
have O
a O
family O
history O
of O
diseases O
/ O
conditions O
that O
put O
me O
at O
risk O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
potentially O
bring O
out O
. O

No O
thanks O
. O



 O
I O
hope O
the O
Metformin B-DRUG
helps O
you O
tremendously O
and O
does O
n't O
cause O
any O
side O
effects O
at O
all O
. O

Surprisingly O
Metformin B-DRUG
gives O
me O
zero O
side O
effects O
if O
taken O
at O
night O
with O
a O
snack O
. O



 O
Wishing O
you O
all O
the O
best O
! O

Humira B-DRUG
is O
a O
$ O
4000 O
medication O
in O
the O
US O
🇺 O
🇸 O
.... O
omg O
I O
can O
only O
imagine O
the O
suffering O
in O
Lebanon O
without O
meds O

I O
’ve O
been O
on O
topicals O
, O
otezla B-DRUG
, O
and O
am O
supposed O
to O
start O
humira B-DRUG
soon O
, O
but O
the O
only O
thing O
to O
ever O
help O
me O
has O
been O
a O
low O
carb O
/ O
low O
inflammation B-ADR
diet O
. O

I O
started O
with O
a O
dairy O
free O
/ O
gluten O
free O
diet O
for O
about O
3 O
months O
, O
but O
it O
made O
my O
skin O
feel O
so O
itchy B-ADR
and O
irritated B-ADR
after O
anything O
I O
ate O
( O
probably O
withdrawals O
or O
something O
) O
, O
but O
I O
could O
n’t O
deal O
with O
it O
. O

I O
watched O
  O
a O
ton O
of O
YouTube O
specialists O
and O
read O
a O
ton O
of O
research O
studies O
on O
it O
. O

I O
ended O
up O
stumbling O
on O
a O
  O
documentary O
about O
healing O
auto O
immune O
diseases O
( O
specifically O
psoriasis B-ADR
and O
eczema B-ADR
) O
and O
diabetes B-ADR
with O
Keto O
, O
so O
then O
I O
switched O
to O
that O
. O

I O
focused O
on O
vegetables O
, O
fish O
/ O
meat O
, O
some O
dairy O
( O
like O
greek O
yogurt O
and O
full O
fat O
cheese O
) O
, O
and O
berries O
for O
my O
fruit O
. O

I O
stayed O
under O
50 O
net O
carbs O
, O
usually O
averaging O
around O
35 O
a O
day O
, O
for O
6 O
months O
and O
when O
I O
tell O
you O
my O
skin O
cleared O
up O
almost O
completely O
, O
I O
mean O
it O
looked O
like O
faint O
red O
scars B-ADR
of O
my O
previous O
patches O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
attach O
how O
awful O
my O
skin O
was O
before O
a O
low O
inflammation B-ADR
diet O
, O
but O
it O
’s O
helped O
me O
more O
than O
any O
medicine O
ever O
has O
. O
