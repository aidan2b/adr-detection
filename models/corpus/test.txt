Out O
of O
curiosity O
, O
what O
symptoms O
do O
you O
experience O
? O



 O
My O
working O
diagnosis O
is O
MCTD O
, O
also O
seronegative O
aside O
from O
intermittent O
RNP O
( O
doc O
says O
these O
may O
be O
false O
positives O
, O
though O
I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
symptoms O
, O
so O
‚Ä¶ O
) O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
tolerate O
steroids O
well O
, O
and O
hydroxychloroquine B-DRUG
helped O
a O
little O
at O
first O
, O
but O
then O
I O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
breakthrough O
joint O
pain B-ADR
and O
swelling B-ADR
, O
so O
I O
was O
put O
on O
MTX O
. O

That O
* O
really O
* O
helped O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
, O
I O
had O
bad O
oral B-ADR
sores I-ADR
so O
my O
doc O
is O
now O
putting O
me O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O



 O
Point O
being O
, O
there O
are O
other O
meds O
that O
you O
and O
your O
doc O
can O
discuss O
and O
try O
! O

It O
can O
be O
frustrating O
figuring O
out O
what O
works O
, O
but O
I O
hope O
that O
you O
find O
a O
combo O
that O
‚Äôs O
effective O
for O
you O
. O


Hi O
all O
, O
49(F O
) O
, O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
ankylosing B-ADR
spondylitis I-ADR
a O
few O
years O
ago O
. O

Previously O
prior O
to O
AS O
diagnosis O
I O
was O
treated O
with O
plaquenil B-DRUG
and O
had O
great O
results O
. O



 O
I O
developed O
a O
rash B-ADR
in O
March O
last O
year O
after O
starting O
humira B-DRUG
. O

Started O
on O
left O
arm O
but O
is O
now O
up O
both O
arms O
, O
right O
leg O
, O
face O
, O
neck O
and O
scalp O
. O

It O
did O
not O
disappear O
after O
ceasing O
medication O
. O



 O
I O
have O
low B-ADR
platelets I-ADR
, O
muscle B-ADR
joint I-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
fatigue B-ADR
, O
stiffness B-ADR
on O
waking O
, O
positive B-ADR
ANA I-ADR
. O

DFS70 O
was O
256 O
. O

I O
showed O
my O
rheumo O
a O
photo O
of O
what O
looked O
to O
be O
a O
malar B-ADR
rash I-ADR
( O
that O
I O
had O
last O
year O
) O
and O
he O
said O
‚Äú O
that O
does O
look O
like O
the O
lupus B-ADR
mask O
but O
you O
do O
n‚Äôt O
have O
lupus B-ADR
‚Äù O
. O



 O
GP O
ended O
up O
sending O
me O
to O
a O
dermatologist O
for O
the O
rash B-ADR
as O
it O
continued O
to O
spread O
. O

Biopsy O
back O
today O
saying O
consistent O
with O
LE O
. O

Derm O
said O
I O
‚Äôve O
got O
lupus B-ADR
. O

So O
I O
guess O
what O
I O
‚Äôm O
wondering O
is O
, O
is O
the O
biopsy O
enough O
to O
diagnose O
? O

I O
see O
my O
rheumo O
next O
Wednesday O
and O
I O
‚Äôm O
just O
feeling O
so O
confused O
. O

Thanks O
all O

Was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
a O
month O
. O

Got O
hit O
hard O
with O
one O
of O
the O
nasty O
new O
COVID O
variants O
. O

Have O
n‚Äôt O
restarted O
yet O
but O
would O
like O
to O
considering O
most O
of O
my O
symptoms O
have O
gotten O
worse O
since O
going O
off O
- O
so O
I O
guess O
the O
plus O
side O
is O
that O
I O
definitely O
know O
it O
was O
working O
? O


I O
thought O
the O
exact O
same O
thing O
concerning O
the O
RA O
. O

Must O
be O
very O
mild O
disease B-ADR
progression I-ADR
since O
no O
biologics O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
or O
Enbrel B-DRUG
are O
prescribed O
nor O
methotrexate B-DRUG
or O
steroids O
which O
are O
pretty O
much O
gold O
standard O
for O
moderate O
to O
severe O
RA O
. O

Also O
agree O
that O
Tylenol B-DRUG
is O
an O
odd O
choice O
of O
pain B-ADR
relief O
. O



 O
Yeah O
, O
definitely O
must O
not O
be O
showing O
high O
inflammation B-ADR
markers O
or O
RF O
, O
bc O
you O
know O
she O
'd O
be O
munching O
the O
heck O
outta O
them O
if O
they O
were O
wonky O
lol O
. O


Because O
the O
US O
healthcare O
system O
is O
a O
broken O
joke O
. O

Insurance O
and O
pharmaceutical O
companies O
exist O
to O
make O
profit O
, O
and O
will O
do O
anything O
they O
can O
to O
make O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
horrible O
. O

Keep O
fighting O
OP O
, O
your O
life O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

Your O
fight O
is O
why O
you O
were O
able O
to O
get O
it O
approved O
. O



 O
This O
is O
also O
precisely O
the O
reason O
I O
‚Äôll O
be O
trying O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
my O
first O
treatment O
. O

My O
insurance O
‚Äú O
covers O
‚Äù O
it O
and O
it O
‚Äôs O
easier O
to O
get O
approved O
, O
but O
at O
$ O
500 O
a O
month O
! O

! O

I O
‚Äôll O
be O
utilizing O
the O
manufacturer O
‚Äôs O
financial O
assistance O

I O
‚Äôll O
be O
damned O
if O
I O
‚Äôll O
pay O
$ O
500 O
a O
month O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
more O
interested O
in O
Remicade B-DRUG
, O
but O
that O
‚Äôs O
$ O
1,000 O
a O
month O
. O

They O
have O
a O
financial O
assistance O
program O
too O
thankfully O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n‚Äôt O
include O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
infusion O
itself O
which O
would O
have O
to O
go O
through O
my O
insurance O
. O



 O
It O
‚Äôs O
infuriating O
and O
it O
should O
n‚Äôt O
be O
like O
this O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
thankful O
I O
can O
get O
insurance O
with O
a O
pre O
- O
existing O
condition O
because O
of O
ACA O
, O
but O
that O
‚Äôs O
not O
good O
enough O
. O


Sounds O
like O
HS O

I O
ca O
n‚Äôt O
believe O
none O
of O
the O
derms O
caught O
this O
? O

! O

! O

You O
can O
use O
topical O

antibiotics O
or O
use O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
long O
term O
maintenance O
. O

Laser O
hair O
removal O
may O
help O
too O

I O
‚Äôd O
either O
go O

ask O

talk O
about O

second O
the O
comment O

more O
practical O
than O
remicade B-DRUG

it O
can O
be O
a O
little O
strange O
to O
self O

inject O

you O

was O
it O
bad O
? O

i O
am O
thinking O

starting O
skyrizi B-DRUG
just O
to O
get O
clear O

back O
to O
some O

was O
easy O
for O
me O

I O
mean O
, O
yes O
, O
I O
was O
nervous O
with O
the O
first O
one O
; O
but O
after O
that O
it O
was O
a O
breeze O
. O

Just O
the O
slight O
pain B-ADR
when O
you O
poke O
it O
in O
, O
then O
slowly O
push O
the O
med O
in O
at O
a O
rate O
that O
has O
minimal O
discomfort B-ADR

did O
n't O
cost O
me O
anything O
different O

I O
am O
blessed O
with O
incredible O

Not O
Celiac O
, O
had O
the O
preliminary O
blood O
test O
twice O
but O
not O
high O
enough O
to O
get O
the O
next O
step O

Gluten O
has O
a O
huge O
effect O
on O
my O

even O
with O
the O
Humira B-DRUG

are O
my O
downfalls O

Are O
you O
saying O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
a O
better O
profile O
for O
side O
effects O

reactions O

are O
you O
getting O
that O
from O
? O

Anti O

TNF O
drugs O
are O
known O
for O
being O
the O
most O
immunogenic O
( O
causing O
anti O
- O
drug O
antibodies O
that O
trigger O
reactions B-ADR
) O
, O
they O
also O
suppress O
your O
immune O
system O
more O
systemically O
than O
Entyvio B-DRUG
, O
they O
can O
induce O
psoriasis B-ADR
/ O
lupus B-ADR
, O
etc O
etc O
. O



 O
I O
also O
work O
in O
healthcare O
and O
get O
infusions O
... O

They O
kept O
me O
in O
the O
infusion O
suite O
for O
quite O
awhile O
, O
until O
the O
hives B-ADR
faded O
and O
I O
felt O
normal O
again O
/ O
wasn't O
sleepy B-ADR
from O
the O
iv O
benadryl B-DRUG
. O

  O
But O
nothing O
was O
needed O
to O
make O
sure O
I O
was O
ok O
other O
than O
that O
. O

  O
The O
Remi B-DRUG
allergic B-ADR
reaction I-ADR
is O
a O
known O
possibility O
that O
can O
develop O
at O

the O
process O
( O

that O

at O

back O
in O

 O
I O
am O
currently O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
hidradenitis B-ADR
suppurutiva I-ADR
as O
well O
as O
Entyvio B-DRUG
for O
my O
Crohn O
's O
. O

So O
a O
double O
whammy O
of O
sorts O
, O
lol O
. O

üòÅ O
  O
Humira B-DRUG
may O
be O
what O
they O
switch O
you O
to O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
next O
step O
after O
Remi B-DRUG
for O
a O
lot O
of O
docs O
. O

  O
I O
found O
it O
so O
much O
easier O
, O
as O
it O
's O
self O
inject O
rather O
than O
infusion O
, O
and O
comes O
in O
a O
pen O
form O
. O

 

 O
Glad O
you O
are O
ok O
, O
and O
good O
luck O
! O

! O


bruh O
I O
fucking O
hate O
humira B-DRUG
. O

Worst O
experience O
of O
my O
life O
. O

Initially O
, O
I O
had O
it O
when O
it O
burned B-ADR
to O
go O
into O
my O
body O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
weed B-DRUG
anymore O
but O
I O
still O
use O
it O
for O
my O
body O
aches B-ADR
. O

I O
prefer O
that O
than O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
humira B-DRUG
  O
for O
the O
autoimmune O
disease O

Good O
luck O
! O

They O
will O
say O
use O
aquafour B-DRUG
but O
I O
found O
the O
best O
is O
medicated O
Blistex B-DRUG
for O
lips O
! O

! O

It O
really O
helped O
me O
have O
no O
acne B-ADR
at O
all O
. O

Cleared O
my O
shoulders O
up O
that O
was O
full O
of O
just O
yuckynes O
. O

I O
still O
get O
lumps B-ADR
and O
painful B-ADR
bumps B-ADR
but O
it O
definitely O
reduced O
the O
amount O
for O
me O
at O
least O
. O

I O
started O
when O
I O
19 O
, O
I O
am O
23 O
now O
and O
still O
have O
minimal O
pimples B-ADR
/ O
zits B-ADR
more O
just O
those O
stupid O
lumps B-ADR
that O
pop O
. O

Thinking O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
the O
next O
step O
for O
me O
, O
but O
good O
luck O
on O
your O
journey O
! O

Full O
confidence O
it O
will O
help O
you O
. O


I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
RA O
in O
August O
and O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
in O
September O
, O
I O
was O
on O
biweekly O
injections O
for O
4 O
months O
( O
8 O
injections O
) O
but O
always O
around O
day O
10 O
, O
my O
symptoms O
started O
coming O
back O
and O
my O
pain B-ADR
levels O
increased O
significantly O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
2nd O
week O
. O



 O
In O
January O
I O
went O
to O
weekly O
injections O
and O
I O
am O
so O
happy O
that O
I O
did O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
been O
2 O
months O
since O
increasing O
my O
dose O
and O
I O
am O
feeling O
so O
so O
much O
better O
now O
. O

Some O
days O
, O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
even O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
RA O
. O



 O
If O
you O
‚Äôre O
having O
regular O
break O
through O
pain B-ADR
, O
I O
would O
ask O
about O
increasing O
your O
injection O
frequency O
. O




 O
Good O
luck O
! O


Since O
bowel O
resection O
and O
now O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
I O
have O
no O
more O
than O
3 O
BM‚Äôs O
/ O
day O
. O

  O
Down O
significantly O
from O
25/ O
day O
or O
more O
prior O
to O
surgery O
and O
meds O
. O

BM O
are O
more O
solid O
but O
still O
not O
‚Äú O
normal O
‚Äù O
. O

No O
pain B-ADR
and O
less O
trips O
to O
the O
shitter O
are O
ok O
by O
me O
. O


In O
Brazil O
, O
both O
remicade B-DRUG
and O
humira B-DRUG
are O
free O
too O
. O


I O
did O
before O
talking O
to O
my O
new O
rheumy O
( O
after O
moving O
across O
country O
) O
. O

He O
said O
you O
can O
try O
it O
again O
in O
the O
future O
if O
it O
does O
, O
and O
it O
can O
work O
again O
. O

You O
just O
have O
to O
go O
on O
others O
for O
a O
couple O
years O
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
only O
tried O
humira B-DRUG
and O
it O
fully O
worked O
after O
1 O
- O
2 O
months O
of O
starting O
so O
yeah O
I O
would O
n‚Äôt O
want O
it O
to O
stop B-ADR
working I-ADR
but O
I O
know O
there O
are O
other O
options O
to O
try O
if O
so O
. O

Overthinking O
it O
will O
only O
stress O
you O
out O
and O
stress O
can O
induce O
a O
flare B-ADR
. O

Btw O
I O
had O
all O
of O
these O
questions O
, O
too O
, O
and O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
put O
them O
to O
rest O
was O
talking O
to O
two O
separate O
rheumatologists O
and O
a O
pharmacist O
pretty O
extensively O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
. O


Try O
to O
get O
some O
clindamycin B-DRUG
solution O
from O
your O
doctor O
and O
get O
some O
sulfur O
soap O
and O
ointment O
and O
also O
panoxyl B-DRUG
. O

For O
the O
summer O
use O
tinaction O
powder O
also O
works O
great O
for O
gym O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
should O
help O
a O
lot O
too O
, O
if O
it O
does O
n‚Äôt O
try O
remicade B-DRUG
. O

Drink O
a O
lot O
of O
water O
. O


Xeljanz B-DRUG
made O
me O
nearly O
forget O
I O
had O
RA O
. O

My O
hands O
are O
where O
it O
‚Äôs O
worst O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
pursue O
an O
MFA O
and O
use O
them O
to O
make O
beautiful O
things O
! O

I O
‚Äôm O
currently O
taking O
time O
off O
to O
be O
with O
my O
son O
, O
but O
I O
am O
so O
excited O
to O
have O
the O
career O
of O
my O
dreams O
. O



 O
Humira B-DRUG
allowed O
me O
to O
have O
a O
safe O
pregnancy O
and O
bring O
my O
son O
into O
the O
world O
. O

I O
was O
so O
scared O
I O
would O
n‚Äôt O
be O
able O
to O
have O
a O
successful O
pregnancy O
, O
but O
my O
RA O
never O
made O
it O
any O
more O
difficult O
than O
it O
would O
have O
been O
otherwise O
. O

I O
am O
so O
grateful O
for O
my O
meds O
and O
my O
doctor O
every O
day O
, O
they O
‚Äôve O
given O
me O
everything O
I O
could O
ever O
ask O
for O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
tell O
child O
- O
me O
that O
it O
will O
get O
easier O
and O
give O
her O
a O
big O
hug O
. O


Get O

Probably O
not O
half O
the O
price O

Socialised O

My O

Diagnosed O
22 O
years O
ago O
. O

20 O
of O
those O
years O
on O
biologics O
. O

Currently O
I O
‚Äôm O
on O
Taltz B-DRUG
for O
about O
a O
year O
and O
it O
is O
working O
very O
well O
. O

Before O
that O
I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
5 O
years O
and O
coincidence O
or O
not O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
the O
first O
2 O
Covid O
shots O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
stopped B-ADR
working O
and O
I O
went O
into O
the O
worst O
flare B-ADR
of O
my O
life O
. O

Started O
getting O
psoriasis B-ADR
on O
parts O
of O
my O
body O
I O
never O
had O
it O
before O
in O
22 O
years O
. O

Switched O
to O
Taltz B-DRUG
and O
after O
the O
loading O
doses O
my O
skin O
cleared O
right O
up O
and O
95 O
% O
of O
the O
pain B-ADR
and O
swelling B-ADR
went O
away O
. O

 
 O
Oh O
and O
sorry O
to O
say O
you O
can O
leave O
Taltz B-DRUG
out O
all O
day O
and O
it O
will O
still O
sting B-ADR
like O
hell O
. O


Thanks O
, O
everyone O
! O

My O
symptoms O
began O
about O
5 O
years O
ago O
with O
some O
minor O
joint B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
extreme O
fatigue B-ADR
. O

Eventually O
, O
I O
began O
having O
debilitating O
muscle B-ADR
spasms I-ADR
all O
over O
daily O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
even O
brush O
my O
hair O
without O
having O
a O
spasm B-ADR
" O
catch O
" O
me O
in O
my O
shoulder O
blade O
. O

That O
is O
what O
prompted O
me O
to O
go O
to O
my O
PCP O
. O

She O
tested O
my O
inflammation B-ADR
markers O
, O
which O
were O
extremely O
high O
, O
and O
sent O
me O
to O
a O
rheumatologist O
. O

He O
tested O
me O
for O
everything O
under O
the O
sun O
and O
finally O
diagnosed O
me O
with O
RA O
through O
X O
- O
ray O
. O

That O
diagnosis O
did O
n't O
explain O
the O
muscle B-ADR
spasms I-ADR
, O
but O
the O
meds O
he O
began O
me O
on O
originally O
( O
Arava B-DRUG
) O
made O
them O
go O
away O
almost O
immediately O
, O
but O
did O
little O
else O
. O

He O
then O
added O
Sulfasalazine B-DRUG
, O
then O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

No O
luck O
with O
those O
either O
. O

I O
've O
recently O
moved O
and O
changed O
doctors O
. O

She O
is O
the O
one O
who O
has O
now O
diagnosed O
me O
with O
PsA O
after O
bloodwork O
and O
x O
- O
rays O
that O
showed O
arthritis B-ADR
in O
my O
feet O
, O
as O
well O
as O
several O
bone B-ADR
spurs I-ADR
. O

In O
April O
of O
last O
year O
, O
I O
ruptured O
my O
Achilles O
tendon O
, O
and O
she O
believes O
the O
spurs O
and O
weakening O
in O
the O
tendon O
due O
to O
the O
arthritis B-ADR
is O
probably O
what O
caused O
that O
. O

She O
has O
taken O
me O
off O
of O
all O
of O
the O
meds O
the O
previous O
doctor O
prescribed O
and O
put O
me O
on O
Methotrexate B-DRUG
. O

She O
also O
wants O
me O
to O
start O
Sympani O
infusions O
next O
month O
. O

I O
'm O
willing O
to O
try O
anything O
at O
this O
point O
. O

I O
do O
miss O
the O
Arava B-DRUG
, O
though O
, O
because O
my O
muscle B-ADR
spasms I-ADR
have O
come O
back O
! O



 O
Sorry O
I O
'm O
so O
long O
- O
winded O
! O

:) O

I O
minimal O
improvement O
, O
so O
I O
was O
put O
on O
remicade B-DRUG
and O
once O
I O
developed O
antibodies O
they O
tried O
humira B-DRUG
, O
which O
I O
'm O
allergic B-ADR
to O
apparently O
, O
and O
then O
back O
on O
remicade B-DRUG
with O
mercaptopurine B-DRUG
but O
that O
's O
starting O
to O
fail O
too O
. O


Before O
starting O
a O
humira B-DRUG
biosimilar O
I O
had O
flare B-ADR
after O
flare B-ADR
and O
had O
days O
where O
I O
was O
struggling O
to O
walk O
. O



 O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
the O
humira B-DRUG
biosimilar O
for O
over O
a O
year O
without O
a O
single O
flare B-ADR
. O

This O
morning O
I O
did O
80 O
km O
on O
my O
bike O
. O


My O
allergies B-ADR
definitely O
got O
worse O
on O
humira B-DRUG
to O
the O
point O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
sinus B-ADR
infections I-ADR
until O
I O
found O
a O
solution O
. O

I O
do O
Zyrtec B-DRUG
daily O
and O
Flonase B-DRUG
when O
it O
is O
really O
bad O
. O

If O
it O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
intensified O
allergies B-ADR
, O
paying O
attention O
to O
pollen O
forecasts O
and O
learning O
which O
ones O
are O
worse O
helps O
too O
. O

For O
me O
ragweed O
is O
the O
worst O
so O
when O
that O
one O
is O
high O
I O
sometimes O
even O
wear O
a O
mask O
outside O
( O
not O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
course O
but O
while O
running O
errands O
in O
parking O
lots O
and O
stuff O
. O

The O
air O
recirculation O
button O
on O
your O
car O
can O
help O
too O
) O
. O

It O
makes O
me O
feel O
kind O
of O
ridiculous O
masking O
outside O
but O
it O
does O
work O
well O
for O
me O
so O
I O
guess O
it O
‚Äôs O
worth O
it O
. O

Maybe O
it O
is O
sinus B-ADR
infections I-ADR
after O
all O
but O
try O
treating O
it O
like O
allergies B-ADR
with O
OTC O
stuff O
and O
hopefully O
it O
‚Äôs O
actually O
allergies B-ADR
since O
that O
‚Äôs O
way O
more O
manageable O
from O
home O
than O
infections B-ADR
. O

Good O
luck O
, O
I O
hope O
you O
find O
relief O
! O


no O
i O
was O
not O
tested O
i O
mostly O
get O
colds O
since O
on O
humira B-DRUG
this O
a O
flu O
. O

but O
yeah O
i O
think O
an O
antiviral O
would O
have O
saved O
my O
life O
! O

i O
'll O
have O
to O
do O
that O
the O
next O
time O
. O

i O
'm O
at O
the O
recovery O
stage O
so O
my O
body B-ADR
aches I-ADR
are O
n't O
as O
bad O
as O
those O
previous O
days O
. O


Been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
almost O
3 O
years O
now O
. O

How O
long O
did O
yours O
last O
? O


I O
take O
40 O
mg O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
every O
14 O
days O
. O

After O
the O
loading O
dose O
it O
took O
2 O
months O
to O
really O
notice O
a O
difference O
. O

It O
took O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
year O
for O
me O
to O
be O
in O
remission O
. O

Least O
ways O
, O
that O
was O
my O
experience O
. O

Expect O
everyone O
‚Äôs O
will O
be O
different O
‚Ä¶ O
. O


There O
‚Äôs O
only O
one O
uveitis B-ADR
specialist O
on O
my O
insurance O
plan O
. O

I O
do O
like O
them O
though O
. O

And O
tbh O
the O
main O
reason O
they O
are O
n‚Äôt O
pushing O
the O
drugs O
more O
is O
that O
I O
‚Äôve O
communicated O
how O
worried O
I O
am O
about O
them O
. O

They O
also O
mentioned O
that O
I O
will O
probably O
need O
cataract B-ADR
surgery O
eventually O
. O



 O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
just O
straight O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
my O
insurance O
demands O
I O
start O
with O
something O
cheaper O
and O
fail O
that O
first O
. O

 

 O
I O
did O
she O
a O
Rheum O
. O

I O
tested O
negative O
for O
that O
one O
genetic O
variant O
of O
interest O
and O
got O
a O
negative O
ANA B-ADR
. O

After O
that O
she O
made O
it O
clear O
she O
could O
n‚Äôt O
do O
anything O
to O
help O
until O
I O
was O
ready O
to O
try O
immunosuppressants O
. O


I O
am O
not O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
but O
when O
I O
asked O
about O
alcohol O
consumption O
( O
I O
typically O
only O
have O
a O
single O
glass O
of O
whiskey O
twice O
a O
month O
or O
so O
) O
they O
said O
it O
was O
fine O
on O
biologics O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
/ O
Enbrel B-DRUG
but O
they O
‚Äôd O
advise O
against O
it O
with O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
steroids O
. O

  O
My O
liver O
enzymes O
were O
a O
mess O
for O
3 O
months O
once O
and O
I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
consume O
it O
until O
I O
had O
2 O
sets O
of O
normal O
blood O
work O
under O
my O
belt O
at O
their O
advice O
. O


Thank O
you O
for O
your O
detailed O
and O
informative O
response O
. O

My O
nurse O
echoed O
a O
lot O
of O
this O
, O
including O
Taltz B-DRUG
being O
very O
effective O
for O
the O
skin O
condition O
. O

Luckily O
, O
I O
only O
suffer O
mildly O
from O
skin O
psoriasis B-ADR
at O
the O
moment O
. O



 O
I O
believe O
Amgevita B-DRUG
is O
another O
brand O
name O
for O
Humira B-DRUG
- O
the O
drug O
itself O
being O
abamumilab B-DRUG
( O
I O
‚Äôve O
likely O
spelled O
that O
wrong O
) O
. O



 O
I O
guess O
my O
concern O
is O
you O
point O
about O
immunogenicity B-ADR
over O
a O
period O
of O
years O
seemed O
to O
happen O
in O
under O
a O
month O
for O
me O
. O

My O
drug O
was O
effective O
for O
four O
weeks O
, O
then O
my O
body O
just O
reverted O
back O
to O
being O
as O
bad O
as O
it O
was O
prior O
. O



 O
Fingers O
crossed O
I O
guess O
- O
my O
grandmother O
did O
n‚Äôt O
have O
the O
advantage O
of O
having O
any O
of O
these O
drugs O
when O
she O
was O
alive O
, O
at O
least O
we O
live O
in O
a O
time O
where O
treatment O
is O
evolving O
. O


I O
'm O
glad O
you O
're O
healing O
and O
doing O
well O
on O
humira B-DRUG
. O

If O
it O
's O
only O
been O
a O
month O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
then O
you O
'll O
continue O
healing O
in O
the O
weeks O
and O
months O
ahead O
. O

Possible O
the O
constipation B-ADR
is O
from O
rectal O
inflammation B-ADR
that O
's O
lingering O
( O
if O
your O
Crohn O
's O
had O
rectal O
involvement O
) O
. O



 O
Yes O
, O
this O
illness B-ADR
and O
medicine O
like O
Prednisone B-DRUG
can O
cause O
dramatic O
changes O
to O
our O
bodies O
from O
rapid O
weight B-ADR
loss I-ADR
or O
gain O
, O
acne B-ADR
and O
other O
things O
. O

It O
's O
a O
bit O
traumatic O
at O
first O
. O

  O
I O
'm O
a O
decade O
into O
IBD B-ADR
( O
and O
8 O
continuous O
years O
in O
a O
remission B-ADR
and O
counting O
) O
and O
can O
say O
it O
gets O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

It O
does O
get O
easier O
to O
cope O
once O
you O
get O
to O
know O
your O
enemy O
( O
Crohn O
's O
) O
and O
what O
it O
's O
capable O
of O
in O
your O
case O
. O

We O
might O
lose O
or O
gain O
clothing O
sizes O
due O
to O
the O
changes O
. O

I O
met O
a O
nice O
grandma O
aged O
Crohn O
's O
patient O
who O
had O
Crohn O
's O
for O
over O
30 O
years O
, O
she O
says O
keep O
those O
different O
sizes O
for O
your O
next O
flare O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
quick O
to O
throw O
them O
out O
at O
recovery O
. O

  O
As O
Crohn O
's O
is O
n't O
a O
quick O
sprint O
to O
victory O
, O
rather O
it O
's O
an O
ultra O
- O
triathalon O
made O
of O
many O
of O
different O
stages O
. O



 O
Over O
time O
, O
you O
'll O
return O
to O
your O
normal O
body O
based O
on O
your O
eating O
habits O
and O
excercise O
. O

  O
If O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
regain O
lost O
weight O
, O
eat O
healthy O
foods O
to O
replace O
the O
lost O
nutrients O
from O
your O
flare B-ADR
and O
be O
patient O
as O
that O
's O
a O
process O
that O
will O
take O
6 O
- O
8 O
or O
more O
months O
. O

  O
Eat O
extra O
portions O
of O
meals O
, O
eat O
healthy O
snacks O
between O
meals O
to O
regain O
mass O
. O

Add O
some O
excercise O
in O
to O
regain O
muscle B-ADR
mass I-ADR
lost I-ADR
. O

It O
can O
be O
light O
excercise O
from O
jogging O
, O
yoga O
, O
or O
going O
to O
the O
gym O
( O
elliptical O
and O
treadmills O
are O
great O
, O
as O
are O
weight O
machines O
for O
arms O
, O
back O
, O
etc O
) O
. O


Sorry O
you O
‚Äôre O
dealing O
with O
this O
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
been O
there O
( O
recurrent O
abscesses B-ADR
and O
fistulas B-ADR
) O
and O
in O
my O
experience O
I O
usually O
knew O
something O
was O
wrong O
before O
the O
doctors O
could O
see O
anything O
wrong O
. O

I O
‚Äôd O
trust O
your O
gut O
and O
intuition O
and O
ask O
to O
be O
seen O
if O
the O
pain B-ADR
is O
new O
. O

I O
think O
soreness B-ADR
is O
normal O
and O
it O
‚Äôs O
also O
absolutely O
normal O
to O
have O
anxiety B-ADR
around O
this O
now O
that O
you O
‚Äôve O
experienced O
some O
issues O
with O
healing O
. O

Imo O
it O
‚Äôs O
better O
to O
be O
seen O
. O



 O
Are O
you O
diagnosed O
with O
Crohn O
‚Äôs O
? O

Have O
they O
tried O
biologics O
? O

It O
took O
me O
over O
1.5 O
years O
to O
get O
my O
diagnosis O
after O
the O
onset O
of O
my O
abscess B-ADR
and O
I O
had O
6 O
surgeries O
to O
drain O
or O
repair O
. O

Nothing O
worked O
until O
they O
put O
me O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
then O
I O
healed O
relatively O
quickly O
. O

Best O
of O
luck O
! O


Three O
. O

All O
were O
treated O
with O
steroid O
and O
dilating O
drops O
. O



 O
The O
first O
was O
severe O
and O
sudden O
, O
it O
took O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
to O
settle O
down O
. O

I O
had O
it O
come O
back O
but O
it O
did O
n‚Äôt O
last O
long O
. O

I O
left O
a O
very O
stressful O
job O
which O
I O
‚Äôm O
sure O
helped O
. O



 O
The O
third O
was O
several O
months O
after O
having O
COVID O
. O

This O
time O
, O
my O
vision O
seemed O
off O
but O
I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
have O
the O
terrible O
feeling O
of O
eye B-ADR
strain I-ADR
. O

It O
took O
a O
month O
or O
so O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it O
but O
my O
vision O
and O
comfort O
are O
not O
the O
same O
now O
and O
it O
took O
5 O
months O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
keep O
it O
gone O
. O



 O
My O
eyes O
are O
always O
uncomfortable O
and O
cataracts B-ADR
have O
started O
. O



 O
I O
wear O
transition O
darkening O
lenses O
or O
lightly O
tinted O
eyeglasses O
always O
now O
which O
helps O
. O

Finding O
a O
brand O
of O
moistening O
eye O
drops O
helps O
. O

Eye O
makeup O
is O
not O
happening O
. O

I O
have O
n‚Äôt O
been O
able O
to O
read O
much O
in O
some O
time O
w/o O
eyes O
fatigued B-ADR
. O

If O
it O
‚Äôs O
important O
, O
I O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
because O
I O
miss O
things O
w/o O
knowing O
. O


You O
should O
have O
gotten O
the O
shingles B-ADR
vaccine O
. O

   O
I O
am O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
got O
the O
shingles B-ADR
, O
and O
the O
Covid O
vaccines O
, O
and O
my O
annual O
flu B-ADR
shots O
, O
with O
little O
to O
no O
side O
effects O

  O
My O
arm O
was O
a O
bit O
sore O
after O
a O
recent O
tetanus B-ADR
booster O
shot O
. O

  O
I O
do O
confess O
, O
I O
have O
hardly O
ever O
felt O
anything O
but O
smart O
, O
for O
trusting O
science O
. O

  O
So O
, O
mild O
smugness O
? O


My O
sister O
feels O
the O
same O
way O
. O

She O
has O
Ankylosing B-ADR
Spondylitis I-ADR
and O
just O
recently O
had O
severe B-ADR
edema I-ADR
in O
her O
R O
knee O
and O
ankle O
. O

Went O
to O
ER O
x O
's O
. O

The O
dismissed O
her O
the O
1st O
and O
3rd O
time O
. O

Second O
time O
they O
took O
xray O
of O
R O
ankle O
and O
US O
of O
R O
leg O
looking O
for O
clots B-ADR
. O

Her O
rheumatologist O
, O
  O
podiatrist O
and O
ortho O
are O
unhelpful O
as O
well O
. O

Her O
back O
is O
bloody O
murder O
. O

She O
takes O
her O
Humira B-DRUG
with O
hardly O
any O
benefits O
. O

She O
had O
to O
get O
her O
own O
crutches O
and O
compression O
stockings O
. O

Local O
doctors O
are O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
care O
you O
are O
in O
pain B-ADR
. O

Her O
R O
ankle O
is O
still O
swollen B-ADR
. O

It O
's O
best O
to O
go O
to O
John O
Hopkins O
, O
Mayo O
clinic O
or O
a O
University O
hospital O
. O


How O
are O
you O
now O
? O

Still O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
? O


My O
physical O
wellbeing O
started O
to O
improve O
immensely O
from O
the O
point O
I O
left O
work O
nearly O
4 O
years O
ago O
. O

After O
more O
than O
a O
decade O
of O
both O
misery O
and O
callouts O
for O
pain B-ADR
, O
I O
finally O
told O
them O
I O
could O
not O
do O
it O
anymore O
as O
I O
went O
out O
on O
workers O
compensation O
first O
, O
then O
STD O
, O
and O
now O
LTD O
. O



 O
I O
ended O
up O
with O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
shortly O
after O
leaving O
work O
and O
started O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
I O
have O
gone O
from O
being O
in O
some O
degree O
of O
distracting O
pain B-ADR
3 O
out O
4 O
days O
to O
it O
being O
background O
pain B-ADR
at O
1 O
- O
2 O
level O
almost O
every O
day O
after O
that O
first O
year O
. O

Obviously O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
convinced O
that O
Humira B-DRUG
was O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
helped O
me O
. O

Just O
being O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
I O
am O

again O
üòÖ O
Lesson O
learned O
! O

! O

I O
‚Äôve O
tried O
budesonide B-DRUG
, O
Remicade B-DRUG
, O
and O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
but O
Stelara B-DRUG
seems O
to O
work O
best O
for O
me O
now O
! O

! O


I O
still O
get O
swollen B-ADR
ankles I-ADR
and O
tender B-ADR
joints I-ADR
sometimes O
, O
and O
there O
are O
some O
foods O
I O
stay O
away O
from O
no O
matter O
what O
, O
but O
most O
of O
my O
symptoms O
are O
( O
finally O
) O
manageable O
! O


I O
took O
Humira B-DRUG
2x O
before O
finding O
out O
I O
was O
pregnant O
. O

I O
had O
to O
stop O
and O
then O
I O
had O
5 O
years O
of O
remission O
! O


Humira B-DRUG
is O
helping O
me O
soo O
much O

My O
doc O
suggested O
remicade B-DRUG
, O
but O
my O

. O

Insurance O

cover O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
which O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
for O
a O
month O

am O
also O
taking O
mesalamine B-DRUG
until O
the O
end O
of O

Congratulations O
! O

I. O
Still O
remember O
the O
1st O
injection O
I O
did O
myself O
. O

  O
Its O
a O
big O
accomplishment O
to O
get O
that O
done O
. O


So O
happy O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
use O
citrate O
. O

The O
burn B-ADR
was O
painful B-ADR
. O


I O
started O
humira B-DRUG
in O
2009 O
and O
still O
use O
it O
. O

The O
citrate O
was O
removed O
just O
before O
the O
patent O
expired O
. O

Pretty O
sure O
they O
could O
get O
a O
new O
patent O
and O
keep O
any O
competitors O
at O
bay O
for O
awhile O
. O

  O
4 O
doctors O
and O
2 O
pharmacists O
in O
the O
family O
all O
think O
that O
independently O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
real O
source O
to O
support O
the O
opinions O
. O

 
 O
Congrats O
again O
and O
may O
your O
remission O
be O
soon O
and O
long O
. O


Ask O
your O
primary O
care O
physician O
, O
pain B-ADR
management O
doctor O
, O
or O
someone O
else O
for O
a O
referral O
to O
a O
rheumatologist O
. O

I O
went O
through O
about O
5 O
PCPs O
, O
and O
two O
or O
three O
Pain B-ADR
Management O
doctors O
over O
the O
years O
before O
starting O
to O
think O
it O
was O
related O
to O
arthritis B-ADR
. O

After O
over O
- O
researching O
, O
and O
having O
that O
light O
bulb O
moment O
, O
I O
asked O
my O
PCP O
for O
a O
referral O
to O
see O
a O
rheumatologist O
. O

The O
first O
rheumatologist O
was O
nice O
, O
but O
very O
hesitant O
to O
diagnose O
. O

I O
'm O
usually O
conservative O
myself O
, O
so O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
issue O
with O
it O
. O

When O
he O
* O
was O
n't O
sure O
, O
* O
he O
would O
send O
his O
patients O
to O
a O
much O
bigger O
hospital O
to O
get O
checked O
out O
( O
uPenn O
) O
. O

This O
was O
a O
6 O
month O
wait O
to O
get O
into O
my O
appointment O
, O
but O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

They O
have O
been O
absolutely O
fantastic O
there O
and O
I O
've O
received O
the O
care O
and O
attention O
to O
this O
issue O
I O
've O
been O
searching O
for O
. O

I O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
last O
week O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
hopeful O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
a O
long O
time O
. O



 O
The O
unfortunate O
part O
of O
this O
is O
that O
it O
took O
11 O
years O
to O
get O
to O
this O
point O
( O
pain B-ADR
started O
in O
2011 O
at O
age O
23 O
, O
diagnosed O
in O
2022 O
at O
age O
34 O
) O
. O

And O
it O
had O
to O
come O
via O
my O
own O
research O
and O
requests O
. O

Better O
late O
than O
never O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
lucky O
that O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
fusions O
, O
yet O
, O
despite O
a O
good O
amount O
of O
degeneration O
. O



 O
I O
wish O
I O
knew O
years O
ago O
that O
this O
was O
something O
I O
needed O
to O
figure O
out O
myself O
. O


I O
had O
uvietis B-ADR
. O

Eye O
doctor O
did O
blood O
test O
, O
HLA O
B O
27 O
positive O
. O

MRI O
confirmed O
some O
fusion O
in O
illiac O
joints O
. O



 O
This O
was O
9 O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
'm O
44 O
. O

Looking O
back O
I O
had O
symptoms O
, O
sciatica B-ADR
and O
back B-ADR
pain I-ADR
since O
I O
was O
in O
my O
early O
20s O
. O



 O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
helping O
, O
but O
still O
get O
flares B-ADR
. O



 O
Get O
blood O
tests O
and O
MRI O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
does O
great O
for O
my O
hs O
, O
but O
it O
did O
n't O
do O
tons O
for O
my O
Crohns O
. O

  O
Then O
again O
, O
I O
seem O
to O
be O
one O
of O
those O
folks O
that O
none O
of O
the O
biologics O
seem O
to O
be O
100 O
% O
effective O
. O



 O
I O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
because O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
inject O
, O
has O
the O
best O
customer O
service O
I O
have O
dealt O
with O
in O
regards O
to O
sharps O
containers O
, O
etc O
..... O
and O
I O
've O
been O
on O
most O
of O
the O
biologics O
over O
the O
years O
. O

üòÑ O

Cosentyx B-DRUG
has O
been O
hands O
down O
the O
best O
. O


I O
have O
been O
on O
humira B-DRUG
and O
simponi B-DRUG

Have O
n't O
had O
a O
single O
flare B-ADR
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
five O
years O
now O
. O

Before O
I O
managed O
to O
get O
my O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
die O
, O
but O
I O
seriously O
wondered O
if O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
would O
be O
worth O
living O
. O

Now O
I O
pretty O
much O
forget O
I O
even O
have O
AS O
most O
of O
the O
time O
. O


I O
have O
crohns O
and O
need O
immunosuppressants O
to O
stay O
alive O
( O
humira B-DRUG
) O
and O
avoid O
surgery O
. O

I O
am O
well O
aware O
ill O
be O
dead O
in O
a O
year O
or O
two O
after O
SHTF O
. O

But O
i O
make O
sure O
my O
wife O
is O
prepared O
for O
the O
worst O
. O

The O
quicker O
you O
accept O
death B-ADR
, O
which O
it O
looks O
like O
yoy O
have O
, O
the O
more O
rational O
you O
become O
. O


God O
, O
I O
feel O
for O
ya O
. O

Have O
you O
tried O
Humira B-DRUG
by O
any O
chance O
? O

I O
think O
it O
may O
be O
the O
only O
biologic O
they O
‚Äôve O
approved O
for O
HS O
so O
far O
. O


That O
‚Äôs O
great O
news O
! O

Ah O
yea O
it O
drives O
me O
mad O
when O
I O
see O
those O
posts O
about O
a O
biologic O
failing O
after O
2 O
doses O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
3 O
months O
with O
1 O
year O
of O
MTX B-DRUG
too O
and O
just O
hoping O
the O
4 O
- O
6 O
months O
shows O
a O
sweet O
spot O
of O
relief O
like O
it O
did O
for O
you O
. O


Omg O
yay O
! O

That O
's O
how O
I O
felt O
with O
humira B-DRUG
! O

That O
first O
injection O
was O
amazing O
! O

My O
doctor O
described O
it O
as O
a O
roller O
- O
coaster O
though O
, O
some O
days O
still O
might O
be O
bad O
, O
but O
I O
will O
have O
better O
days O
. O



 O
RA O
exhaustion B-ADR
üò© O
ugh O
something O
I O
never O
want O
to O
experience O
ever O
again O
. O

I O
'm O
glad O
you O
feel O
better O
! O

I O
never O
want O
anyone O
to O
experience O
the O
pain B-ADR
and O
exhaustion B-ADR
RA O
can O
be O
. O

It O
's O
so O
draining O
and O
then O
you O
forget O
a O
bit O
how O
life O
was O
without O
pain B-ADR
and O
fatigue B-ADR
. O


I O
‚Äôm O
taking O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
my O
HS O
and O
during O
an O
insurance O
snafu O
I O
came O
off O
it O
and O
my O
scalp O
broke O
out O
with O
psoriasis B-ADR
. O

I O
used O
the O
ketoconazole B-DRUG
shampoo O
to O
help O
clear O
it O
and O
it O
definitely O
helped O
with O
inflammation B-ADR
! O

Taking O
antibiotics O
long O
term O
can O
cause O
resistance O
and O
other O
problems O
, O
probably O
why O
your O
derm O
is O
trying O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
them O
! O


12 O
years O
and O
counting O
for O
humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
apparently O
have O
some O
inflammation B-ADR
present O
on O
mri O
and O
ultrasound O
but O
only O
minor O
symptoms O
so O
far O
. O

My O
guess O
is O
I O
‚Äôll O
be O
moving O
to O
another O
medication O
sooner O
than O
later O
, O
but O
no O
idea O
whether O
that O
‚Äôs O
months O
or O
years O
! O


I O
find O
it O
helps O
to O
talk O
to O
people O
who O
are O
in O
the O
same O
boat O
. O

It O
can O
be O
frustrating O
and O
eventually O
depressing O
when O
others O
think O
you O
are O
making O
it O
up O
or O
are O
just O
plain O
nuts O
. O

Do O
n‚Äôt O
give O
up O
, O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
helped O
me O
tremendously O
! O


I O
have O
personally O
had O
two O
biologics O
( O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Stelara B-DRUG
) O
stop B-ADR
working I-ADR
after O
sick B-ADR
( O
both O
times O
I O
was O
sick B-ADR
I O
had O
strep B-ADR
throat I-ADR
. O


I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
4 O
years O
. O

Zero O
side O
effects O
and O
virtually O
total O
remission O
. O

The O
injection O
is O
n't O
really O
bad O
especially O
after O
you O
've O
done O
it O
a O
few O
times O
. O

The O
loading O
dose O
is O
the O
worst O
because O
you O
have O
to O
do O
4 O
at O
once O
. O

Before O
you O
know O
it O
you O
'll O
be O
injecting O
like O
a O
pro O
without O
giving O
it O
a O
second O
thought O
. O



 O
There O
will O
be O
the O
odd O
time O
you O
get O
the O
wrong O
spot O
, O
or O
not O
quite O
the O
right O
angle O
and O
it O
will O
hurt O
like O
hell O
... O
but O
only O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
. O

And O
the O
benefits O
far O
FAR O
outweigh O
the O
occasional O
pain B-ADR
. O



 O
I O
promise O
you O
that O
a O
year O
or O
so O
from O
now O
you O
'll O
be O
the O
one O
writing O
reassuring O
comments O
to O
people O
here O
:) O


 O
EDIT O
: O
I O
've O
taken O
Humira B-DRUG
on O
several O
trips O
without O
any O
issues O
. O

Iceland O
, O
France O
and O
the O
US O
. O

It O
needs O
to O
be O
in O
your O
carry O
on O
and O
I O
just O
show O
it O
at O
the O
security O
checkpoint O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
length O
of O
the O
trip O
you O
can O
also O
carry O
it O
un O
- O
refrigerated O
. O

I O
put O
it O
in O
the O
refrigerator O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
reach O
my O
destination O
though O
. O

But O
that O
does O
n't O
reset O
the O
clock O
. O

Once O
it O
has O
reached O
room O
temperature O
it O
has O
to O
be O
used O
within O
the O
un O
- O
refrigerated O
window O
. O


I O
just O
spoke O
to O
my O
doc O
to O
get O
off O
HS O
. O

We O
are O
suspecting O
Humira B-DRUG
induced O
Lupus B-ADR
as O
I O
have O
joint B-ADR
pains I-ADR
and O
fatigue B-ADR
. O

Humira B-DRUG
did O
well O
for O
my O
HS O
in O
the O
beginning O
but O
in O
the O
past O
3 O
months O
, O
my O
HS O
has O
been O
making O
a O
comeback O
. O

No O
significant O
flares B-ADR
but O
several O
mini O
flares B-ADR
. O

I O
truly O
hope O
Humira B-DRUG
works O
for O
you O
. O


I O
‚Äôm O
starting O
humira B-DRUG
if O
bloods O
are O
all O
okay O
. O



 O
I O
was O
on O
ciclosporin B-DRUG
but O
it O
stopped B-ADR
being I-ADR
as I-ADR
efficient I-ADR
so O
I O
‚Äôve O
had O
no O
meds O
for O
2 O
months O

I O
am O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
started O
it O
during O
covid O
. O

I O
basically O
avoided O
people O
/ O
places O
for O
the O
most O
part O
but O
now O
I O
just O
wear O
a O
mask O
in O
public O
, O
whether O
it O
protects O
me O
or O
not O
it O
makes O
me O
feel O
safer O
. O


I O
just O
got O
switched O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
waiting O
to O
see O
what O
my O
insurance O
will O
cover O
‚Ä¶ O
I O
asked O
my O
rheum O
dr O
about O
how O
to O
afford O
it O
and O
he O
said O
if O
insurance O
covers O
nothing O
to O
call O
the O
pharmacy O
and O
ask O
if O
they O
will O
cover O
some O
, O
or O
if O
that O
does O
n‚Äôt O
work O
to O
tell O
the O
dr O
office O
and O
they O
will O
take O
care O
of O
it/ O
supply O
coupons O
. O

Best O
of O
luck O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
super O
worried O
to O
see O
how O
I O
‚Äôll O
afford O
this O
as O
well O

I O
had O
been O
struggling O
to O
find O
a O
medicine O
that O
worked O
for O
me O
for O
TWO O
YEARS O
after O
I O
stopped O
taking O
humira B-DRUG
because O
" O
I O
felt O
better O
" O
( O
DONT O
STOP O
TAKING O
YOUR O
MEDS O
OMG O
) O
and O
after O
4 O
different O
biologics O
we O
ended O
up O
trying O
Remicade B-DRUG
. O

After O
almost O
2.5 O
years O
of O
daily O
, O
horrifying O
crohns O
pain B-ADR
and O
diarrhea B-ADR
and O
vomiting B-ADR
and O
starving B-ADR
.... O
one O
dose O
of O
Remicade B-DRUG
... O
I O
was O
symptom O
free O
the O
next O
day O
. O

My O
doctors O
told O
me O
it O
would O
take O
a O
while O
though O
so O
as O
not O
to O
get O
my O
hopes O
up O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
on O
2 O
maybe O
3 O
years O
with O
it O
now O
, O
no O
symptoms O
and O
I O
eat O
whatever O
I O
want O
. O

Good O
luck O
you O
got O
this O
! O

! O


I O
had O
COVID O
in O
early O
2020 O
though O
it O
was O
n‚Äôt O
obvious O
at O
the O
time O
. O

I O
was O
really O
sick B-ADR
for O
3 O
weeks O
, O
the O
cough B-ADR
lasted O
a O
year O
, O
my O
sense O
of O
taste O
/ O
smell O
is O
finally O
returning O
. O



 O
I O
do O
have O
long O
COVID O
symptoms O
/ O
pattern O
. O



 O
COVID O
did O
n‚Äôt O
cause O
my O
autoimmune O
disorder O
but O
it O
did O
send O
it O
off O
the O
rails O
. O

I O
have O
sarcoidosis B-ADR
with O
uveitis B-ADR
and O
migrating O
arthritis B-ADR
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
this O
which O
helped O
my O
eyes O
but O
made O
any O
exposure O
to O
bacterial B-ADR
infection I-ADR
much O
worse O
. O

I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
when O
I O
received O
a O
tick O
bite O
. O



 O
Poor O
dietary O
choices O
for O
me O
( O
including O
avoiding O
problematic O
foods O
for O
me O
personally O
like O
chocolate O
) O
mean O
my O
symptoms O
worsen O
. O

However O
, O
idea O
dietary O
choices O
does O
not O
prevent O
a O
flare B-ADR
. O

Similar O
story O
with O
sleep O
. O



 O
For O
me O
, O
flares B-ADR
seem O
to O
be O
driven O
by O
: O
infectious B-ADR
diseases I-ADR
, O
stress O
, O
and/or O
air O
pollution O
. O


Yes O
, O
I O
have O
or O
am O
doing O
it O
right O
now O
, O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
80 O
mg O
a O
week O
, O
ended O
up O
getting O
horrible O
side O
effects O
when O
I O
went O
from O
40 O
mg O
to O
80 O
mg O
a O
week O
. O

Anyway O
only O
on O
my O
4th O
dosage O
, O
but O
it O
works O
, O
it O
‚Äôs O
crazy O
, O
you O
get O
it O
and O
the O
next O
week O
or O
so O
you O
just O
kind O
of O
just O
purge O
them O
all O
out O
or O
at O
least O
I O
did O
. O

I O
hands O
down O
would O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
that O
needs O
it O
and O
can O
tolerate O
it O
, O
although O
I O
personally O
have O
never O
heard O
of O
anyone O
not O
tolerating O
it O
. O

The O
results O
for O
me O
are O
better O
than O
humira B-DRUG
. O


Do O
n't O
let O
your O
insurance O
company O
interrupt O
your O
treatment O
or O
you O
can O
develop B-ADR
immunity I-ADR
. O



 O
They O
totally O
will O
too O
, O
insurance O
Is O
the O
closet O
thing O
reality O
has O
to O
evidence O
of O
Satan O
. O



 O
Humira B-DRUG
Is O
pretty O
painless O
and O
generally O
low O
on O
side O
effects O
. O


Take O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
live O
your O
life O
. O

Biologics O
are O
fabulous O
! O


I O
agree O
with O
the O
other O
redditor O
too O
! O



 O
But O
I O
get O
her O
side O
of O
it O
. O

This O
disease O
can O
make O
the O
kindest O
people O
turn O
stubborn O
and O
bitter O
. O

RA O
is O
an O
exhausting O
illness B-ADR
to O
have O
. O

Constant O
pain B-ADR
, O
no O
days O
off O
, O
etc O
. O

  O
so O
putting O
it O
off O
makes O
complete O
sense O
to O
me O
. O

RA O
has O
given O
me O
a O
depression B-ADR
I O
hope O
no O
one O
ever O
has O
to O
know O
. O

And O
you O
do O
n‚Äôt O
even O
realize O
that O
‚Äôs O
what O
it O
is O
. O



 O
You O
‚Äôre O
doing O
what O
you O
can- O
you O
even O
came O
here O
for O
help O
. O

Truth O
is- O
she O
has O
to O
want O
it O
herself O
. O

I O
am O
34 O
, O
had O
it O
since O
9 O
months O
old O
and O
only O
started O
to O
actually O
treat O
it O
6 O
years O
ago O
. O

I O
deeply O
regret O
not O
starting O
sooner O
. O

As O
you O
are O
correct- O
my O
disease O
progressed O
and O
quickly O
. O

I O
have O
maybe O
10 O
degrees O
to O
work O
with O
on O
my O
left O
wrist O
. O

So O
that O
does O
n‚Äôt O
move O
, O
I O
developed O
spondylitis B-ADR
and O
hashimotos B-ADR
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
no O
joke O
and O
I O
‚Äôm O
honestly O
glad O
she O
‚Äôs O
not O
worse O
off O
. O

But O
maybe O
show O
her O
some O
of O
our O
testimonies O
.. O
being O
as O
it O
‚Äôs O
completely O
relatable O
to O
her O
life O
. O

2 O
years O
ago O
I O
started O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
I O
was O
able O
to O
lift O
my O
small O
children O
over O
my O
head- O
I O
was O
never O
able O
to O
do O
that O
before O
. O

Let O
her O
know O
that O
while O
there O
are O
side O
effects O
, O
living O
for O
now O
is O
more O
important O
. O

The O
moment O
I O
was O
able O
to O
lift O
them O
, O
I O
cried O
the O
happiest O
tears O
ever O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
life O
changing O
. O

But O
it O
‚Äôs O
a O
process O
. O

And O
as O
always O
, O
some O
medicines O
work O
and O
some O
do O
n‚Äôt O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
gave O
me O
psoriasis B-ADR
. O

It O
sucked O
but O
I O
moved O
on O
and O
kept O
truckin O
. O

I O
just O
started O
remicade B-DRUG
today O
and O
I O
can O
already O
feel O
it O
working O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
an O
uphill O
battle O
. O



 O
Diet O
plays O
little O
to O
no O
role O
( O
for O
me O
) O
I O
‚Äôve O
learned O
unless O
you O
fast O
entirely O
. O

Literally O
I O
‚Äôve O
tried O
it O
all O
. O

I O
ate O
non O
inflammatory O
foods O
for O
weeks- O
no O
help O
. O

My O
doctor O
( O
and O
a O
group O
of O
doctors O
) O
spent O
6 O
million O
on O
an O
independent O
food O
study O
in O
RA O
treatment- O
inconclusive O
and O
he O
was O
n‚Äôt O
about O
to O
waste O
more O
money O
proving O
diet O
is O
n‚Äôt O
enough O
) O


 O
Ultimately O
, O
this O
illness B-ADR
does O
n‚Äôt O
just O
affect O
me- O
it O
involves O
my O
whole O
household O
. O

So O
it O
is O
your O
issue O
as O
much O
as O
hers O
. O

I O
know O
her O
mindset O
and O
it O
‚Äôs O
a O
selfish O
one O
as O
much O
as O
it O
hurts O
to O
hear- O
I O
was O
there O
-but O
I O
agree O
someone O
has O
to O
help O
her O
see O
another O
way O
! O

Good O
luck O
! O


i O
used O
to O
be O
needle O
phobic O
now O
I O
self O
inject O
mtx B-DRUG
and O
humira B-DRUG
, O
u O
can O
get O
used O
to O
it O
if O
you O
make O
it O
a O
priority O

Similar O
to O
another O
commenter O
, O
my O
insurance O
made O
me O
try O
a O
cheaper O
alternative O
before O
approving O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
was O
literally O
on O
steroids O
until O
it O
gave O
me O
significant O
cataracts B-ADR
and O
I O
hated O
getting O
the O
steroids O
. O



 O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
been O
awesome O
, O
it O
‚Äôs O
also O
helped O
with O
other O
inflammation B-ADR
/ O
auto B-ADR
immune I-ADR
issues I-ADR
I O
was O
having O
so O
that O
‚Äôs O
cool O
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
been O
using O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
a O
year O
or O
so O
now O
and O
I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
major O
side O
effects O
so O
I O
definitely O
recommend O
! O


Okay O
, O
you O
said O
" O
it O
" O
when O
we O
were O
talking O
about O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

There O
are O
multiple O
pill O
options O
for O
UC O
coming O
out O
lately O
( O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
, O
Zeposia B-DRUG
, O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
, O
Jyseleca O
) O
so O
if O
you O
need O
to O
get O
back O
on O
meds O
at O
some O
point O
hopefully O
one O
will O
work O
for O
you O
. O


I O
‚Äôm O
so O
surprised O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
n‚Äôt O
helped O
your O
HS O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
done O
amazing O
things O
for O
me O
. O


They O
said O
they O
were O
going O
to O
watch O
it O
and O
discuss O
at O
a O
future O
appointment O
. O

Since O
I O
was O
on O
Mercaptopurine B-DRUG
and O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
a O
while O
and O
just O
recently O
stopped O
the O
Mercaptopurine B-DRUG
she O
wants O
to O
see O
if O
it O
improves O
on O
it O
's O
own O
. O

I O
do O
lose O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
blood O
thanks O
to O
hemorrhoids B-ADR
so O
I O
'm O
sure O
that O
does O
n't O
help O
either O
lol O
. O


My O
husband O
failed O
meslamine O
, O
remicade B-DRUG
, O
humira B-DRUG
, O
stelara B-DRUG
, O
and O
xeljanz B-DRUG
. O

We O
were O
met O
with O
a O
surgeon O
in O
March O
, O
preparing O
for O
that O
inevitability O
, O
but O
then O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
was O
approved O
. O

He O
started O
taking O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
the O
end O
of O
May O
( O
took O
forever O
for O
insurance O
to O
approve O
üôÑ O
) O
. O

Just O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
he O
had O
an O
endoscopy O
showing O
amazing O
improvement O
. O

He O
has O
been O
feeling O
it O
too O
, O
but O
the O
endoscopy O
was O
good O
to O
confirm O
. O

His O
Dr O
is O
even O
taking O
him O
off O
the O
loading O
dose O
and O
moving O
to O
the O
higher O
maintenance O
dose O
. O

That O
is O
the O
first O
time O
that O
he O
's O
made O
it O
off O
a O
loading O
dose O
. O

So O
in O
less O
than O
3 O
months O
, O
it O
's O
done O
more O
for O
him O
than O
months O
more O
of O
anything O
else O
! O


Humira B-DRUG
started O
work O
for O
me O
after O
the O
first O
injection O
, O
but O
stopped O
after O
4 O
. O

I O
have O
developed O
anti O
- O
drug O
antibodies O
, O
I O
go O
for O
Remicade B-DRUG
and O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

Since O
I O
have O
a O
good O
( O
but O
short O
) O
answer O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
we O
decided O
that O
  O
the O
next O
medication O
also O
should O
be O
TNF O
inhibitors O
but O
different O
structure O
. O

So O
right O
now O
I O
'm O
on O
Enbrel B-DRUG
( O
4 O
months O
) O
and O
it O
's O
working- O
inflammation B-ADR
signs O
in O
normal O
ranges O
and O
pain B-ADR
goes O
down O
significantly O
. O

So O
the O
point O
is O
to O
try O
different O
types O
of O
medication O
for O
example O
IL6 O
blockers O
, O
maybe O
it O
will O
for O
you O
. O

Good O
luck O
! O


Humira B-DRUG
retail O
price O
is O
350 O
$ O
for O
40 O
mg O
and O
700 O
$ O
for O
80 O
mg O
. O


Another O
vote O
for O
checking O
the O
immunocompromised O
box O
. O

I O
am O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
so O
it O
technically O
counts O
, O
but O
no O
questions O
or O
proof O
was O
needed O
. O


You O
‚Äôre O
welcome O
. O

I O
am O
not O
in O
the O
US O
so O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
know O
the O
brand O
names O
, O
but O
I O
went O
onto O
cyclosporin B-DRUG
which O
is O
the O
one O
that O
gave O
me O
wacky O
side O
effects O
. O

Now O
I O
take O
mycophenolate B-DRUG
mofetil I-DRUG
and O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
there O
are O
no O
serious O
side O
effects O
, O
at O
least O
for O
me O
. O

The O
glaucoma B-ADR
surgery O
was O
n‚Äôt O
ideal O
I O
guess O
, O
and O
I O
wish O
I O
‚Äôd O
been O
able O
to O
start O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
way O
way O
sooner O
to O
avoid O
having O
the O
surgery O
so O
young O
( O
I O
‚Äôm O
in O
my O
20s O
) O
but O
it O
is O
what O
it O
is O
. O

My O
vision O
is O
almost O
back O
to O
20/20 O
with O
glasses O
now O
after O
being O
flared B-ADR
up O
for O
2 O
+ O
years O
constantly O
since O
originally O
being O
diagnosed O
. O


I O
'm O
afraid O
I O
'm O
no O
help O
with O
getting O
2 O
approved O
, O
but O
can O
your O
doctor O
change O
your O
dosage O
? O

You O
're O
taking O
1 O
Humira B-DRUG
shot O
every O
other O
week O
now O
? O

Can O
they O
increase O
that O
to O
once O
a O
week O
? O

I O
knew O
a O
woman O
who O
was O
taking O
it O
that O
frequently O
for O
awhile O
so O
that O
must O
be O
an O
option O
. O

 

 O
When O
I O
changed O
biologics O
last O
summer O
, O
it O
look O
about O
5 O
- O
6 O
months O
for O
everything O
to O
go O
back O
to O
nearly O
clear O
. O

It O
really O
flared B-ADR
up I-ADR
about O
a O
month O
or O
two O
after O
I O
switched O
from O
Humira B-DRUG
to O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
, O
lingered O
for O
a O
month O
or O
two O
, O
then O
finally O
improved O
. O

So O
maybe O
, O
hopefully O
, O
yours O
will O
improve O
? O



 O
Either O
way O
, O
best O
of O
luck O
to O
you O
! O


Been O
on O
a O
humira B-DRUG
biosimilar O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
every O
now O
and O
then O
I O
‚Äôll O
get O
something O
like O
this O
. O

I O
would O
n‚Äôt O
worry O
too O
much O
but O
worth O
mentioning O
it O
to O
your O
rheumatologist O
. O


I O
was O
doing O
so O
good O
on O
humira B-DRUG
I O
would O
accidentally O
forget O
to O
take O
a O
shot O
here O
and O
there O
and O
when O
I O
did O
take O
them O
I O
would O
be O
late O
. O

Long O
story O
short O
, O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
of O
that O
and O
I O
ended O
up O
in O
a O
major B-ADR
flare I-ADR
and O
had O
2 O
years O
of O
steroids O
and O
a O
resection O
. O


I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
RA O
at O
16 O
, O
and O
my O
father O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
AS O
at O
29 O
. O

The O
doctors O
told O
him O
for O
years O
it O
was O
in O
his O
head O
. O

He O
is O
on O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
and O
I O
‚Äôm O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O



 O
I O
‚Äôm O
so O
very O
sorry O
, O
AS O
is O
a O
hell O
of O
a O
disease O
. O

When O
my O
dad O
was O
diagnosed O
at O
29 O
they O
told O
him O
he O
already O
had O
the O
back O
of O
an O
80 O
year O
old O
. O

He O
‚Äôs O
now O
in O
his O
50 O
‚Äôs O
and O
it O
‚Äôs O
awful O
seeing O
his O
mobility O
suffer O
but O
he O
‚Äôs O
always O
smiling O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
so O
sorry O
you O
‚Äôre O
always O
in O
pain B-ADR
, O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
find O
a O
combination O
of O
medications O
that O
work O
for O
you O
to O
give O
you O
the O
most O
pain B-ADR
free O
life O
possible O
! O

The O
strength O
you O
have O
is O
incredible! O
‚ô• O
Ô∏è O

Yes O
, O
I O
was O
given O
a O
sample O
pack O
of O
Enbrel B-DRUG
. O

I O
had O
started O
taking O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
it O
really O
messed O
me O
up O
bad O
. O

Dr O
gave O
me O
the O
sample O
pack O
to O
get O
me O
started O
on O
something O
since O
I O
was O
doing O
so O
bad O
, O
and O
hoping O
insurance O
would O
approve O
it O
, O
they O
of O
course O
did O
not O
. O

I O
am O
now O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

After O
two O
weeks O
of O
the O
sample O
of O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
what O
I O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
dark O
cloud O
lifted O
. O

I O
woke O
up O
and O
realized O
I O
felt O
different O
, O
better O
. O

The O
brain B-ADR
fog I-ADR
and O
fatigue B-ADR
was O
gone O
, O
pain B-ADR
still O
there O
but O
everything O
else O
was O
gone O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
has O
kept O
that O
away O
for O
now O
, O
but O
my O
pain B-ADR
is O
still O
intense O
and O
I O
'm O
of O
course O
having O
side O
effects O
from O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
that O
we O
are O
working O
on O
. O


Not O
the O
same O
brand O
, O
but O
I O
had O
one O
of O
these O
and O
the O
fan O
went O
out O
not O
even O
a O
year O
after O
purchasing O
it O
. O

I O
did O
n‚Äôt O
notice O
til O
a O
week O
later O
. O

I O
would O
hate O
for O
that O
to O
happen O
while O
your O
Humira B-DRUG
is O
in O
there O
. O


Exactly O
. O

I O
was O
on O
Mesalamine B-DRUG
. O

No O
problem O
with O
hair O
. O

Went O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
my O
thick O
curly O
hair O

reduce O

 O
I O
'm O
sure O
part O
of O
the O
reason O
I O

less O
is O
that O
I O
am O

have O
only O

I O
was O

I O
was O
on O
humira B-DRUG
weekly O

the O
humira B-DRUG
hangover B-ADR
got O
to O
me O
. O

The O
day O
after O
the O
injection O
was O
almost O
like O
a O
mini O
flare B-ADR
. O

Limping B-ADR
around O
, O
hurting B-ADR
pretty O
badly O
. O

I O
was O
on O
bi O
weekly O
humira B-DRUG
, O
with O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
but O
dropped O
the O
metho B-DRUG
because O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
were O
trying O
for O
a O
baby O
, O
started O
having O
peripheral O
arthritis B-ADR
pain B-ADR
, O
so O
upped O
the O
humira B-DRUG
to O
weekly O
. O



 O
After O
I O
said O
enough O
of O
the O
hangovers B-ADR
( O
probably O
was O
on O
weekly O
six O
months O
) O
, O
switched O
to O
enbrel B-DRUG
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
doing O
alright O
but O
no O
hangovers B-ADR
which O
is O
a O
big O
plus O

Good O
luck O
with O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

Had O
four O
years O
of O
solid O
remission O
on O
it O
, O
zero O
symptoms O
. O


On O
Humira B-DRUG
I O
had O
severe O
neurological B-ADR
issues I-ADR
and O
had O
to O
walk O
with O
a O
cane O
due O
to O
lack B-ADR
of I-ADR
balance I-ADR
( O
I O
was O
37 O
at O
the O
time O
and O
had O
never O
had O
trouble B-ADR
walking I-ADR
) O
I O
could O
not O
hold O
a O
conversation O
and O
my O
heart B-ADR
rate I-ADR
was I-ADR
elevated I-ADR
to O
over O
110 O
regularly O
. O

My O
GP O
identified O
that O
the O
root O
cause O
was O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
once O
I O
stopped O
within O
6 O
weeks O
I O
was O
almost O
fully O
back O
to O
normal O
, O
but O
Humira B-DRUG
definitely O
did O
a O
number O
on O
me O
. O

Off O
Humira B-DRUG
now O
and O
on O
Remicade B-DRUG

I O
am O
doing O
great O
, O
I O
walk O
over O
10k O

a O

recently O
a O

you O
‚Äôre O
allowed O
to O
go O
straight O
to O
Stelara B-DRUG
instead O
of O
attempting O
a O
TNF O
blocker O
first O
, O
I O
personally O
would O
. O

Each O
person O
‚Äôs O
response O
is O
different O
, O
but O
my O
story O
is O
Humira B-DRUG
- O
> O
xeljanz B-DRUG
- O
> O
remicade B-DRUG
- O
> O
just O
started O
Stelara B-DRUG
. O

I O
have O
a O
theory O
that O
had O
I O
started O
Remicade B-DRUG
or O
Stelara B-DRUG
earlier O
, O
instead O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
when O
my O
disease O
was O
less O
severe O
, O
they O
would O
have O
taken O
better O
. O

Just O
food O
for O
thought O
! O


i O
believe O
i O
m O
developing O
antibodies O
as O
well O
. O

back O
in O
May O
my O
doctor O
tested O
to O
see O
the O
Remicade B-DRUG
in O
my O
body O
and O
they O
could O
n‚Äôt O
even O
detect O
nothing O
. O

So O
with O
all O
these O
symptoms O
I O
do O
believe O
it O
‚Äôs O
antibodies O
. O

My O
doctor O
and O
I O
agreed O
to O
move O
on O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
after O
my O
incident O
today O
and O
I O
hope O
that O
goes O
well O
for O
me O
. O

I O
m O
glad O
u O
found O
a O
medication O
that O
helped O
u O
! O

! O


Nothing O
that O
I O
remember O
. O



 O
I O
had O
both O
doses O
while O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

I O
was O
very O
grateful O
that O
my O
rheumatologist O
recommendation O
it O
. O

I O
have O
exactly O
zero O
desire O
to O
ever O
get O
Shingles B-ADR
. O


  O
It O
may O
have O
been O
humira B-DRUG
? O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
... O
( O
I O
have O
another O
relative O
with O
RA O
, O
so O
I O
may O
be O
mixing O
up O
who O
took O
which O
med O
. O

They O
both O
possibly O
did O
. O

) O
  O
I O
do O
know O
there O
was O
another O
med O
she O
was O
taking O
for O
it O
which O
made O
her O
dizzy B-ADR
. O

She O
fell O
several O
times O
( O
while O
on O
blood O
thinners O
) O
and O
ended O
up O
with O
a O
hemorrhagic B-ADR
stroke I-ADR
. O


Thanks O
. O

I O
am O
honestly O
used O
to O
it O
at O
this O
point O
‚Ä¶ O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
UC O
around O
14 O
and O
I O
‚Äôm O
44 O
now O
so O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
dealing O
with O
bowel B-ADR
related I-ADR
issues I-ADR
for O
a O
long O
time O
! O

I O
am O
very O
lucky O
that O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
worked O
for O
my O
AS O
for O
so O
long O
, O
and O
I O
‚Äôm O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
it O
was O
not O
a O
long O
term O
solution O
for O
you O
. O

I O
really O
hope O
you O
can O
find O
something O
soon O
that O
helps O
with O
both O
the O
AS O
and O
the O
UC O
üôè O
üèª O

I O
wish O
my O
mom O
had O
known O
about O
the O
genetic O
risk O
before O
having O
children O
. O

I O
have O
been O
in O
severe O
chronic B-ADR
pain I-ADR
since O
I O
can O
remember O
. O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
severe O
early O
childhood O
onset O
AS O
at O
4 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
old O
by O
the O
( O
then O
) O
only O
pediatric O
rheumatologist O
on O
the O
east O
coast O
. O

I O
have O
always O
been O
in O
pain B-ADR
and O
I O
always O
will O
be O
. O

I O
have O
n‚Äôt O
responded O
to O
the O
multiple O
biologics O
I O
‚Äôve O
tried O
, O
In O
fact O
, O
when O
I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
I O
developed O
bacterial B-ADR
pneumonia I-ADR
and O
then O
eosinophilic O
asthma B-ADR
which O
I O
still O
have O
and O
which O
severely O
limits O
my O
lung O
function O
. O

I O
am O
certainly O
a O
rarer O
case O
than O
most O
, O
but O
I O
want O
you O
all O
to O
know O
that O
it O
happens O
. O

If O
my O
mom O
had O
known O
her O
diagnosis O
and O
risk O
for O
passing O
it O
on O
to O
me O
and O
still O
had O
me O
, O
I O
would O
truthfully O
have O
some O
resentment O
towards O
her O
for O
it O
. O

I O
personally O
chose O
long O
ago O
never O
to O
bring O
a O
child O
into O
this O
world O
knowing O
there O
‚Äôs O
a O
chance O
they O
would O
feel O
this O
pain B-ADR
. O

Even O
if O
I O
had O
a O
milder O
form O
of O
the O
disease O
, O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
think O
I O
would O
want O
biological O
children O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
. O


Most O
big O
companies O
have O
programs O
like O
this O
for O
the O
expensive O
drugs O
. O

My O
dad O
has O
psoriasis B-ADR
and O
gets O
humira B-DRUG
for O
$ O
5 O
a O
month O
through O
one O

It O
will O
be O
okay O
! O

I O
‚Äôm O
a O
total O
wimp O
, O
and O
I O
sometimes O
pass O
out O
around O
the O
sight O
of O
blood O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
used O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
was O
off O
the O
charts O
. O

But O
it O
‚Äôs O
really O
not O
bad O
and O
Humira B-DRUG
comes O
with O
a O
handy O
injection O
pen O
( O
kind O
of O
like O
an O
epipen B-DRUG
) O
. O




 O
I O
recently O
bought O
a O
Shot O
Blocker O
. O

Shot O
Blockers O
were O
designed O
to O
make O
injections O
less O
painful O
for O
children O
. O

I O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
doubts O
, O
but O
it O
works O
beautifully O
with O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
pen O
. O

I O
ca O
n‚Äôt O
even O
feel O
the O
injection O
. O


Unfortunately O
, O
this O
means O
your O
body O
is O
producing B-ADR
antibodies I-ADR
to O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
and O
the O
reactions O
will O
get O
progressively O
worse O
, O
while O
the O
effectiveness B-ADR
goes I-ADR
down I-ADR
over O
time O
. O

You O
must O
not O
continue O
using O
Humira B-DRUG
. O



 O
You O
should O
try O
switching O
to O
another O
biologic O
. O


I O
started O
humira B-DRUG
a O
few O
months O
ago O
for O
Crohns O
. O

I O
have O
a O
reaction B-ADR
like O
this O
immediately O
after O
injection O
if O
I O
do O
not O
take O
Benadryl B-DRUG
. O

It O
will O
start O
with O
a O
small O
spot O
and O
join O
into O
one O
large O
one O
before O
disappearing O
. O

The O
weird O
thing O
is O
is O
that O
it O
returns O
the O
next O
day O
before O
disappearing O
again O
. O

Does O
any O
one O
else O
have O
a O
reaction B-ADR
like O
this O
? O

The O
doctor O
recommended O
icing O
the O
site O
before O
injection O
, O
but O
this O
is O
n‚Äôt O
going O
to O
prevent O
the O
same O
reaction B-ADR
from O
coming O
back O
the O
next O
few O
days O
. O


I O
think O
I O
might O
have O
felt O
similarly O
the O
first O
few O
times O
, O
but O
it O
went O
away O
for O
me O
. O

I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
well O
over O
a O
year O
so O
I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
for O
sure O
. O

I O
would O
say O
if O
it O
does O
n't O
get O
better O
after O
maybe O
four O
shots O
reassess O
with O
your O
rheumatologist O
. O

If O
the O
side O
effects O
are O
so O
bad O
you O
ca B-ADR
n't I-ADR
function I-ADR
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
medication O
is O
worth O
it O
and O
you O
should O
probably O
try O
something O
else O
instead O
. O


Everyone O
‚Äôs O
body O
reacts O
differently O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
works O
GREAT O
for O
my O
sister O
yet O
it O
made O
me O
MUCH O
worse O
and O
they O
had O
to O
take O
me O
off O
it O
. O


Wishing O
you O
the O
best O
‚ô• O
Ô∏è O

I O
just O
got O
the O
same O
message O
from O
my O
Kaiser O
rheumy O
today O
! O

I O
have O
also O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
\~2ys O
, O
so O
I O
am O
equally O
terrified O
to O
change O
meds O
. O

I O
'm O
on O
it O
for O
RA O
though O
... O
I O
guess O
were O
on O
a O
similar O
journey O
... O
Good O
luck O
to O
you O
! O


I O
do O
... O
well O
I O
think O
about O
my O
chronic B-ADR
pain I-ADR
daily O
as O
I O
also O
have O
fibromyalgia B-ADR
. O

So O
if O
it O
's O
not O
back O
/ O
joint B-ADR
inflammation I-ADR
, O
it O
's O
fibromyalgia B-ADR
. O

I O
'm O
always O
having O
to O
calculate O
my O
energy O
levels O
, O
my O
pain B-ADR
levels O
, O
and O
how O
bad O
my O
brain B-ADR
fog I-ADR
is O
. O

I O
've O
recently O
been O
dealing O
with O
a O
flare O
of O
back B-ADR
pain I-ADR
which O
is O
leading O
towards O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
AS O
and O
I O
do O
my O
3rd O
injection O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
tomorrow O
. O



 O
I O
've O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
Fibromyalgia B-ADR
since O
2004 O
so O
that O
's O
an O
old O
hat O
and O
a O
familiar O
pattern O
. O

This O
AS O
stuff O
though O
it O
's O
tough O
and O
totally O
different O
. O

I O
'm O
also O
learning O
a O
lot O
more O
about O
AS O
and O
realizing O
that O
stuff O
I O
( O
or O
my O
doctors O
) O
have O
put O
in O
the O
fibromyalgia B-ADR
bucket O
or O
a O
separate O
category O
like O
" O
general O
lower B-ADR
back I-ADR
pain I-ADR
" O
, O
TMJ O
, O
or O
my O
chronic O
anemia B-ADR
that O
got O
resolved O
by O
an O
iron O
infusion O
( O
nothing O
else O
worked O
) O
might O
be O
all O
involved O
with O
AS O
. O

It O
's O
super O
frustrating O
( O
and O
makes O
me O
a O
bit O
angry O
) O
as O
I O
'm O
realizing O
that O
if O
I O
possibly O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
fibromyalgia B-ADR
diagnosis O
, O
I O
might O
have O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
AS O
a O
lot O
earlier O
and O
would O
have O
possibly O
not O
gotten O
arthritis B-ADR
in O
my O
shoulders O
, O
both O
hips O
, O
and O
some O
vertabre O
. O

Also O
have O
spurring O
and O
scelrosis O
in O
my O
SI O
joint O
. O


I O
have O
Crohns O
and O
take O
Humira B-DRUG
on O
day O
4 O
of O
Covid O
and O
have O
been O
taking O
Paxlovid B-DRUG
with O
no O
issues O
so O
far O
. O

Mild O
diarrhea B-ADR
once O
or O
twice O
, O
but O
Covid O
symptoms O
can O
cause O
that O
, O
along O
with O
Paxlovid O
in O
anyone O
. O

Mild O
stomach B-ADR
pains I-ADR
and O
twitches B-ADR
at O
times O
, O
but O
that O
's O
also O
prorbely O
because O
I O
found O
I O
've O
ost B-ADR
my I-ADR
appetite I-ADR
and O
struggled B-ADR
to I-ADR
eat I-ADR
much O
. O


I O
'm O
so O
sorry O
, O
it O
's O
all O
so O
messed O
up O
. O

I O
have O
comparatively O
good O
insurance O
and O
it O
's O
still O
a O
struggle O
, O
having O
to O
make O
multiple O
calls O
a O
week O
to O
deal O
with O
copay O
card O
issues O
, O
getting O
bills O
for O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
dollars O
. O

My O
employer O
actually O
hired O
an O
outside O
consulting O
firm O
to O
help O
people O
navigate O
these O
issues O
, O
which O
is O
utterly O
insane O
( O
I O
am O
so O
unbelievably O
grateful O
for O
this O
help O
, O
but O
it O
should O
n't O
be O
necessary O
) O
. O



 O
I O
had O
an O
insurance O
person O
tell O
me O
it O
's O
because O
I O
was O
" O
choosing O
" O
to O
take O
one O
med O
over O
an O
another O
and O
that O
I O
" O
had O
all O
the O
power O
" O
. O

I O
take O
Stelara B-DRUG
. O

There O
is O
n't O
anything O
else O
in O
that O
class O
, O
generic O
or O
otherwise O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
the O
issues O
people O
have O
are O
apparently O
with O
cancer B-ADR
treatments O
, O
as O
if O
people O
with O
cancer B-ADR
are O
choosing O
to O
take O
one O
med O
over O
another O
due O
to O
brand O
loyalty O
or O
some O
BS O
. O

I O
think O
though O
that O
this O
attitude O
among O
people O
who O
work O
at O
insurance O
companies O
that O
the O
issue O
is O
patients O
demanding O
specific O
meds O
when O
they O
have O
other O
choices O
explains O
why O
there O
's O
so O
little O
cooperation O
/ O
help O
/ O
sympathy O
on O
the O
part O
of O
insurance O
. O

Nobody O
is O
putting O
themselves O
through O
this O
stress O
because O
they O
just O
want O
to O
take O
Humira B-DRUG
or O
Stelara B-DRUG
instead O
of O
methotrexate B-DRUG
. O


Humira B-DRUG
then O
Cosyntex O
then O
Tremfya B-DRUG
. O

Not O
sure O
it O
's O
the O
one O
... O

The O
insurance O
EOB O
for O
my O
son O
's O
humira B-DRUG
shows O
$ O
3500 O
every O
14 O
days O
. O

  O
We O
only O
pay O
$ O
1500 O
for O
the O
first O
dose O
then O
it O
's O
fully O
covered O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O

. O


Yep O
, O
this O
basically O
describes O
my O
lower O
back O
and O
legs O
. O

I O
had O
it O
for O
maybe O
10 O
years O
before O
diagnosis O
. O



 O
It O
got O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
could O
hardly O
elevate O
my O
legs O
without O
quick O
pain B-ADR
/ O
numbness B-ADR
, O
now O
I O
‚Äôm O
on O
humira B-DRUG
it O
‚Äôs O
really O
helped O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
is O
more O
similar O
to O
Remicade B-DRUG
in O
how O
it O
treats O
the O
illness B-ADR
and O
the O
rate O
of O
developing O
antibodies O
. O

Stelara B-DRUG
works O
differently O
and O
has O
a O
lower O
rate O
of O
developing O
antibodies O
. O

There O
‚Äôs O
no O
real O
way O
of O
knowing O
how O
a O
medicine O
will O
work O
for O
you O
until O
you O
try O
. O


Yea O
, O
I O
've O
been O
on O
remicade B-DRUG
, O
humira B-DRUG
, O
stelara B-DRUG
, O
lialda B-DRUG
, O
and O
a O
few O
more O
I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
the O
name O
of O
. O

I O
'm O
that O
9 O
% O
that O
nothing O
works O
for O
8) O

It O
sounds O
like O
it O
, O
are O
you O
HLA O
B O
27 O
positive O
? O



 O
Because O
the O
biologics O
are O
expensive O
the O
NHS O
really O
want O
to O
be O
thorough O
before O
prescribing O
them O
. O

An O
MRI O
will O
check O
for O
fusion O
in O
the O
SI O
joints O
/ O
spine O
. O



 O
If O
you O
do O
get O
biologics O
, O
it O
should O
slow O
down O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
disease O
, O
and O
reduce O
inflammation B-ADR
. O


I O
'm O
on O
humira B-DRUG
/ O
imraldi B-DRUG
, O
and O
it O
has O
relieved O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
pain B-ADR
I O
got O
with O
back B-ADR
pain I-ADR
and O
SI B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

But O
I O
still O
get O
fatigue B-ADR
. O



 O
They O
will O
do O
a O
chest O
x O
- O
ray O
before O
you O
go O
on O
to O
any O
injections O
, O
to O
check O
for O
TB B-ADR
and O
other O
infections B-ADR
. O



 O
A O
nurse O
will O
show O
you O
how O
to O
inject O
yourself O
. O

And O
you O
'll O
get O
injections O
delivered O
to O
your O
door O
, O
which O
you O
will O
keep O
in O
the O
fridge O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
on O
40 O
mg O
imraldi B-DRUG
every O
other O
week O
. O

Injecting O
is O
not O
as O
bad O
as O
it O
sounds O
, O
and O
you O
'll O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O

I O
've O
found O
they O
help O
immensely O
, O
as O
the O
static O
pain B-ADR
was O
debilitating O
. O



 O
You O
'll O
do O
blood O
tests O
every O
6 O
months O
to O
check O
on O
inflammation B-ADR
markers O
and O
any O
other O
issues O
. O



 O
It O
is O
an O
immunosuppressive O
drug O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
I O
did O
n't O
really O
see O
much O
difference(touch O
wood O
) O
, O
in O
9 O
years O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
ill O
that O
much O
, O
apart O
from O
COVID O
twice O
and O
the O
odd O
flu B-ADR
. O



 O
I O
hope O
this O
helps O
, O
that O
is O
if O
you O
are O
put O
on O
biologics O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
much O
about O

. O



 O
Are O
you O

I O

my O

be O
wise O
. O



 O
Over O
15 O

years O
I O
have O
had O
3 O
major O

 O
Less O

three O
years O

my O

back O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
after O
having O
been O
on O
Stelara B-DRUG
for O
many O
years O

for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
15 O
- O
20 O
yrs O

 O
Personally O
, O
I O
've O
been O
married O
12 O
years O
and O
have O
an O
adorable O
2 O
year O
old O
son O
. O

I O
worked O
in O
strategy O
consulting O
for O
a O
decade O
before O
making O
a O
family O
decision O
to O
stop O
working O
so O
I O
could O
focus O
on O
health O
and O
starting O
a O
family O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
it O
's O
been O
an O
easy O
20 O
years O
but O
I O
have O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
very O
fulfilling O
life O
so O
far O
. O


I O
live O
mostly O
pain B-ADR
free O
on O
Imraldi O
, O
a O
humira B-DRUG
biosimilar O
. O

My O
life O
has O
improved O
100 O
% O
. O


I O
‚Äôm O
now O
pregnant O
and O
get O
some O
SI B-ADR
pain I-ADR
but O
that O
‚Äôs O
common O
in O
pregnancy O
anyway O
and O
I O
‚Äôm O
hopeful O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
suffer O
too O
much O
! O


I O
'm O
not O
a O
mom O
, O
but O
know O
that O
you O
need O
to O
take O
care O
of O
yourself O
first O
so O
that O
you O
can O
be O
the O
best O
mom O
to O
your O
little O
one O
, O
so O
this O
is O
all O
aimed O
at O
helping O
you O
. O



 O
Is O
your O
pain B-ADR
mostly O
in O
your O
hip O
? O

I O
had O
excruciating O
hip B-ADR
pain I-ADR
, O
and O
pretty O
much O
nothing O
worked O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
my O
PsA O
was O
pretty O
okay O
, O
but O
man O
my O
hip O
was O
the O
worst O
pain B-ADR
in O
my O
life O
. O

I O
got O
to O
the O
point O
where O
Humira B-DRUG
stopped B-DRUG
working I-DRUG
completely O
, O
no O
matter O
the O
dose O
. O

Taltz B-DRUG
did O
n't O
work O
either O
. O



 O
So O
, O
I O
got O
my O
hip O
replaced O
at O
39 O
. O

It O
was O
like O
a O
miracle O
. O

I O
walked O
on O
it O
the O
same O
day O
without O
pain B-ADR
( O
high O
as O
hell O
at O
the O
hospital O
, O
but O
still O
. O

) O
It O
was O
honestly O
the O
best O
thing O
I O
've O
ever O
done O
. O



 O
Now O
, O
I O
'm O
able O
to O
control O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
pain B-ADR
with O
methotrexate B-DRUG
and O
steroids B-DRUG
. O

It O
's O
bananas O
. O



 O
Take O
a O
look O
at O
getting O
a O
hip O
replacement O
sooner O
rather O
than O
later O
. O

It O
was O
soooo O
worth O
it O
. O

Being O
able O
to O
walk O
without O
screaming O
or O
crying O
is O
the O
best O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
so O
sorry O
-- O
the O
pain B-ADR
is O
so O
hard O
to O
even O
think O
past O
. O

:( O

Enbrel B-DRUG
kept O
me O
perpetually O
sick B-ADR
for O
about O
six O
months O
with O
viral O
respiratory B-ADR
infections I-ADR
. O

Humira B-DRUG
, O
Cimzia B-DRUG
, O
and O
Simponi B-DRUG
have O
been O
just O
fine O
. O

I O
might O
get O
a O
2 O
day O
sinus B-ADR
infection I-ADR
now O
and O
then O
, O
and O
I O
notice O
cuts O
/ O
acne B-ADR
take O
a O
little O
longer O
to O
heal O
, O
but O
my O
overall O
quality O
life O
is O
wonderful O
now O

I O
was O
on O
remicade B-DRUG
every O
6 O
weeks O
. O

But O
I O
have O
been O
switched O
to O
a O
" O
biosimilar O
" O
that O
starts O
with O
a O
" O
a O
" O
but O
I O
do O
not O
know O
exactly O
what O
I O
was O
infused O
with O
last O
week O
. O

I O
think O
its O
been O
helping O
me O
. O

Humira B-DRUG
did O
nothing O
for O
me O
at O
all O
. O


Could O
be O
Hidradenitis B-ADR
Suppurativa I-ADR
. O

Do O
you O
take O
anything O
for O
it O
, O
have O
you O
been O
to O
a O
doctor O
, O
have O
you O
tried O
Humira B-DRUG
? O


Pharmaceutical O
companies O
will O
argue O
that O
‚Äú O
similar O
is O
not O
identical O
, O
‚Äù O
because O
generic O
medications O
generally O
have O
to O
demonstrate O
80 O
% O
of O
the O
brand O
drug O
‚Äôs O
efficacy O
( O
most O
are O
higher O
) O
to O
receive O
FDA O
approval O
. O



 O
A O
phrase O
circulating O
in O
current O
lobbying O
efforts O
is O
‚Äú O
bio O
similar O
is O
not O
bio O
identical O
, O
‚Äù O
as O
generic O
drugs O
like O
Humira B-DRUG
( O
adalimumab B-DRUG
) O
are O
approved O
to O
enter O
the O
market O
. O

What O
they O
do O
n‚Äôt O
mention O
is O
that O
a O
significant O
in O

( O
lab O
) O
difference O
  O
does O
not O
mean O
there O
is O
a O
significant O
clinical O
difference O
( O
the O
effect O
on O
patient O
outcomes O
in O
real O
life O
) O
. O

And O
even O
when O
there O
* O
is O
* O
a O
significant O
clinical O
difference O
, O
it O
may O
be O
so O
small O
that O
having O
a O
generic O
drug O
is O
still O
far O
, O
far O
better O
for O
overall O
outcomes O
because O
patients O
will O
be O
much O
more O
able O
to O
afford O
( O
and O
thus O
adhere O
to O
) O
a O

Thanks O
for O
this O
full O
dialog O
i O
appreciate O
it O
. O

I O
m O
fairly O
new O
to O
crohns O
thread O
and O
while O
i O
m O
not O
diagnosed O
yet O
i O
can O
very O
well O
have O
it O
. O



 O
Also O
lets O
be O
optomistic O
they O
find O
a O
cure O
as O
I O
do O
nt O
find O
it O
to O
be O
out O
the O
realm O
of O
possibilities O
. O

Granted O
our O
systems O
are O
complicated O
. O

The O
affects O
of O
crohns O
for O
most O
seem O
pretty O
narrowed O
down O
. O

And O
with O
use O
of O
biologics O
seems O
like O
people O
are O
getting O
tons O
of O
relife O
that O
you O
are O
seeing O
which O
is O
amazing O
so O
I O
think O
we O
can O
see O
it O
in O
our O
life O
times O
. O

I O
will O
def O
talk O
to O
my O
doctor O
, O
I O
still O
have O
tests O
to O
be O
done O
to O
see O
what O
s O
going O
on O
in O
there O
. O



 O
I O
had O
mild O
inflammation B-ADR
in O
early O
2021 O
idk O
how O
that O
look O
now O
. O

Thus O
i O
was O
doing O
pretty O
okay O
till O
now O
. O

Just O
had O
occasional O
bloating B-ADR
and O
stabbing O
pains B-ADR
maybe O
few O
times O
a O
week O
. O



 O
Funny O
how O
i O
ve O
noticed O
alot O
of O
ppl O
say O
they O
got O
crohns O
in O
covid O
verses O
before O
ti O
that O
blows O
mind O
. O

like O
can O
covid O
possibly O
be O
a O
cause O
? O

? O



 O
Also O
when O
yours O
started O
, O
what O
were O
your O
symtoms O
? O

And O
are O
you O
in O
remission O
currently O
or O
that O
is O
possible O
to O
come O
while O
taking O
the O
humira B-DRUG
? O

Also O
do O
you O
eat O
whatever O
you O
want O
now O

I O
've O
been O
taking O
40 O
mg O
bi O
- O
weekly O
for O
3 O
years O
now O
and O
have O
zero O
side O
effects O
beyond O
some O
very O
minor O
itching B-ADR
for O
a O
day O
or O
two O
at O
the O
injection O
site O
. O

  


 O
My O
symptoms O
and O
progression O
before O
starting O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
were O
not O
severe O
, O
but O
back B-ADR
issues I-ADR
were O
bad O
enough O
to O
force O
me O
to O
leave O
my O
job O
4 O
years O
ago O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
my O
back B-ADR
issues I-ADR
have O
improved O
significantly O
( O
possibly O
more O
so O
due O
to O
not O
working O
) O
, O
and O
stiffness B-ADR
and O
pain B-ADR
that O
I O
was O
getting O
in O
my O
hands O
is O
significantly O
reduced O
with O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

( O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
when O
COVID O
became O
a O
thing O
, O
and O
both O
back O
and O
hand O
stiffness B-ADR
returned O
. O

) O
 


 O
All O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
done O
for O
me O
is O
to O
help O
. O


I O
'm O
in O
the O
UK O
and O
they O
always O
put O
us O
on O
the O
cheapest O
meds O
first O
before O
going O
to O
other O
things O
. O

I O
'm O
on O
Azathioprine B-DRUG
at O
the O
moment O
and O
very O
grateful O
it O
's O
working O
. O

it O
costs O
me O
next O
to O
nothing O
and O
if O
I O
decide O
to O
move O
abroad O
it O
's O
affordable O
enough O
where O
I O
can O
supply O
it O
myself O
. O

I O
'm O
on O
humira B-DRUG
too O
but O
they O
will O
take O
me O
off O
that O
after O
a O
year O
or O
so O
I O
believe O
because O
of O
the O
cost O
. O

I O
agree O
that O
doctors O
do O
n't O
always O
get O
it O
right O
, O
my O
first O
GI O
doc O
was O
pretty O
awful O
and O
prescribed O
me O
6MP O
which O
I O
hated O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
give O
a O
shit O
about O
giving O
me O
meds O
that O
affected B-ADR
my I-ADR
fertility I-ADR
( O
I O
'm O
in O
my O
20s O
) O
. O

I O
stopped O
taking O
pretty O
much O
every O
medicine O
he O
prescribed O
because O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
for O
me O
, O
and O
on O
the O
one O
occasion O
he O
did O
prescribed O
me O
something O
that O
worked O
he O
wanted O
to O
switch O
it O
out O
for O
something O
cheaper O

Pain B-ADR
free O
since O
humira B-DRUG
, O
sometimes O
I O
forget O
I O
have O
AS O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
has O
been O
my O
wonder O
drug O
. O

  O
Gave O
me O
my O
life O
back O
11 O
years O
ago O
. O

  O
Was O
a O
long O
road O
of O
so O
so O
drug O
treatments O
for O
a O
number O
of O
years O
. O

  O
It O
did O
n‚Äôt O
prevent O
a O
resection O
but O
it O
has O
kept O
my O
crohns O
in O
remission O
for O
quite O
some O
time O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
right O
after O
high O
school O
with O
both O
rheumatoid B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
and O
diabetes B-ADR
! O

College O
was O
definitely O
rocky O
with O
flares B-ADR
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
the O
whole O
time O
, O
but O
failed O
my O
first O
two O
biologics O
( O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
Enbrel B-DRUG
. O

) O


 O
I O
‚Äôm O
now O
26 O
and O
I O
teach O
full O
time O
. O

I O
finally O
found O
an O
infusion O
( O
Simponi B-DRUG
ARIA I-DRUG
) O
that O
has O
me O
mostly O
in O
remission O
. O



 O
It O
‚Äôs O
crazy O
to O
look O
back O
on O
those O
rough O
flares O
because O
I O
‚Äôm O
doing O
so O
much O
better O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
also O
able O
to O
be O
much O
more O
active O
which O
helps O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
a O
wild O
illness B-ADR
to O
have O
while O
young O
and O
so O
few O
people O
our O
age O
understand O
what O
we O
‚Äôre O
going O
through O
. O



 O
I O
find O
it O
‚Äôs O
sometimes O
helpful O
to O
take O
medicine O
before O
bed O
in O
order O
to O
sleep O
off O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
side O
effects O
. O

I O
hope O
this O
new O
medicine O
works O
well O
for O
you O
and O
you O
find O
yourself O
feeling O
more O
rested O
and O
happy O
. O


Before O
my O
improved O
health O
, O
it O
was O
so O
bad O
it O
hurt O
to O
walk O
. O

I O
was O
so O
stiff O
I O
was O
barely O
able O
to O
tie O
my O
shoes O
. O


Now O
, O
I O
feel O
almost O
100 O
% O
normal O
. O

Once O
in O
a O
while O
I O
‚Äôll O
run O
into O
someone O
who O
has O
n‚Äôt O
seen O
me O
for O
years O
, O
and O
they O
ca O
n‚Äôt O
stop O
telling O
me O
how O
good O
I O
look O
. O

I O
sometimes O
say O
that O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
aged O
backwards O
, O
because O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
110 O
years O
old O
during O
that O
time O
. O

Lowered O
stress O
, O
exercise O
and O
biologics O
made O
the O
change O
happen O
. O

I O
dealt O
with O
some O
AS O
symptoms O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
but O
it O
was O
never O
THAT O
bad O
until O
I O
went O
through O
a O
highly O
stressful O
time O
, O
and O
stopped O
exercising O
. O

I O
take O
a O
Humira B-DRUG
dose O
about O
every O
6 O
weeks O
, O
which O
is O
enough O
for O
me O
. O

Every O
2 O
weeks O
was O
actually O
too O
much O
‚Äî O
I O
got O
bladder O
and O
eye B-ADR
infections I-ADR
. O

So O
, O
I O
want O
to O
say O
, O
getting O
your O
life O
back O
CAN O
BE O
POSSIBLE O
, O
and O
I O
wish O
everyone O
here O
the O
best O
. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
OP O
and O
everyone O
posting O
their O
encouraging O
stories O
. O

Keep O
in O
mind O
that O
people O
who O
get O
better O
are O
less O
likely O
to O
be O
thinking O
about O
AS O
and O
spending O
time O
posting O
here O
, O
so O
it O
may O
make O
it O
seem O
more O
hopeless O
than O
it O
really O
is O
. O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
mean O
to O
minimize O
anyone O
‚Äôs O
pain B-ADR
and O
struggle O
, O
but O
keeping O
hope O
is O
really O
important O
. O


The O
internet O
can O
be O
wonderful O
but O
also O
scary O
ha O
. O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
Crohn O
‚Äôs O
at O
18 O
, O
I O
am O
32 O
now O
and O
lead O
a O
normal O
life O
! O

They O
did O
catch O
it O
early O
so O
after O
a O
6 O
month O
stint O
on O
Prednisone B-DRUG
( O
hello O
moon B-ADR
face I-ADR
as O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
to O
college O
, O
ugh O
) O
and O
trial O
and O
error O
on O
two O
drugs O
I O
was O
as O
better O
. O

I O
also O
have O
IBS B-ADR
and O
more O
of O
my O
issues O
seem O
related O
to O
that O
and O
my O
anxiety B-ADR
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
about O
10 O
years O
and O
in O
remission O
just O
about O
the O
entire O
time O
. O

I O
have O
n‚Äôt O
developed O
any O
issues O
with O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
it O
‚Äôs O
been O
great O
for O
me O
. O

The O
thing O
that O
keeps O
me O
from O
leading O
as O
normal O
of O
a O
life O
as O
I O
want O
to O
is O
my O
own O
anxiety B-ADR
. O

Mostly O
about O
going O
out O
and O
getting O
sick B-ADR
while O
I O
am O
out O
. O

But O
I O
am O
working O
on O
it O
with O
my O
therapist O
and O
on O
some O
meds O
, O
so O
doing O
what O
I O
can O
! O

I O
am O
married O
and O
just O
had O
my O
first O
child O
, O
and O
caring O
about O
her O
24/7 O
has O
been O
a O
nice O
distraction O
to O
get O
me O
out O
of O
my O
head O
. O

I O
try O
to O
eat O
healthy O
most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
exercise O
when O
I O
can O
. O

A O
normal O
life O
is O
definitely O
possible O
. O

Just O
take O
care O
of O
your O
body O
as O
best O
you O
can O
, O
have O
some O
patience O
with O
yourself O
, O
and O
try O
to O
not O
let O
those O
intrusive O
thoughts O
creep O
in O
! O


I O
switched O
from O
another O
medication O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

  O
The O
previous O
one O
gave O
my O
a O
sinus B-ADR
infection I-ADR
almost O
every O
time O
I O
took O
the O
shot O
. O

  O
And O
it O
got O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
was O
on O
meds O
for O
it O
constantly O
and O
nothing O
seemed O
to O
help O
. O


I O
‚Äôve O
been O
diagnosed O
for O
nearly O
13 O
years O
so O
my O
memory O
/ O
timeline O
is O
a O
bit O
hazy O
in O
places O
. O




 O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
in O
the O
July O
and O
started O
on O
my O
first O
biologic O
( O
Infliximab B-DRUG
) O
in O
November O
of O
the O
same O
year O
. O

I O
‚Äôd O
tried O
and O
failed O
asacol B-DRUG
, O
azathioprine B-DRUG
and O
several O
courses O
of O
prednisolone B-DRUG
so O
infliximab B-DRUG
was O
the O
next O
logical O
step O
. O

It O
worked O
brilliantly O
for O
a O
year O
and O
then O
lost O
its O
effect O
over O
another O
year O
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
also O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
( O
worked O
great O
for O
about O
3 O
years O
) O
, O
then O
got O
swapped O
to O
Imraldi B-DRUG
( O
eventually O
developed B-ADR
antibodies I-ADR
to O
it O
and O
it O
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
) O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
now O
on O
Stelara B-DRUG
and O
it O
‚Äôs O
been O
working O
brilliantly O
for O
3 O
- O
4 O
years O
, O
with O
currently O
no O
signs O
of O
loss B-ADR
of I-ADR
effect I-ADR
. O


Wondered O
why O
Americans O
here O
only O
talk O
about O
Humira B-DRUG
. O

My O
rheumy O
offered O
me O
a O
choice O
of O
the O
four O
brands O
on O
the O
PBS O
, O
based O
on O
which O
injector O
would O
be O
easiest O
on O
my O
hands O
. O

Effectively O
all O
adalimumab B-DRUG
so O
that O
was O
the O
decider O
. O

  
 O
Can O
only O
sympathise O
with O
some O
of O
the O
heartache O
you O
guys O
go O
through O
without O
public O
healthcare O
. O


Fistula B-ADR
are O
a O
never O
- O
ending O
story O
. O

Got O
diagnosed O
with O
IBD B-ADR
in O
2015 O
. O

Got O
quite O
happy O
with O
Azathioprine B-DRUG
therapy O
and O
Mesalazine B-DRUG
treatment O
. O

Went O
abroad O
to O
Australia O
in O
' O
17 O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
high O
sun O
exposure O
I O
got O
phototoxic B-ADR
burns I-ADR
under O
Azathioprine B-DRUG
although O
I O
used O
sunscreen O
. O

Actually O
nothing O
happened O
when O
I O
skipped O
treatment O
. O

Worked O
as O
a O
predicab O
driver O
to O
gain O
some O
money O
for O
my O
studies O
. O

One O
day O
in O
October O
I O
realised O
some O
abnormal O
pain B-ADR
and O
a O
growing O
bump B-ADR
. O

When O
getting O
in O
fever B-ADR
I O
went O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

They O
cut O
open O
an O
abscess B-ADR
  O
- O
told O
me O
due O
to O
trauma O
by O
cycling O
my O
bartholin O
gland O
got O
inflamed B-ADR
. O


Two O
weeks O
later O
- O
same O
happened O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

Did O
n't O
cycle O
at O
all O
. O

This O
time O
they O
refused O
to O
cut O
due O
to O
the O
different O
location O
- O
they O
could O
n't O
really O
reach O
. O

Just O
got O
some O
antibiotics O
. O

Fever B-ADR
again O
until O
it O
just O
popped O
. O


Felt O
a O
lot O
better O
after O
that O
but O
would O
did O
n't O

all O
. O


Went O
back O
to O
Germany O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
term O
to O
finish O
studies O
and O
look O
for O
a O
job O
. O


Went O
to O
different O
Gastroenterologist O
, O
Gyns O
, O
GPs O
... O
no O
one O
had O
answers O
just O
treatment O
options O
that O
did O
not O
work O
. O



 O
Summer O
' O
18 O
I O
moved O
to O
Berlin O
and O
I O
ended O
up O
at O
the O
Charit√© O
and O
finally O
the O
diagnosed O
me O
specifically O
with O
chrons O

and O
told O
me O
that O
they O
found O

Got O
Remicade B-DRUG

Hello O
, O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
around O
18 O
years O
old O
. O

I O
went O
through O
the O
ringer O
of O
treatments O
, O
mostly O
variations O
of O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
which O
were O
unsuccessful O
, O
until O
I O
was O
put O
on O
enbrel B-DRUG
, O
a O
speciality O
medication O
. O

It O
worked O
great O
for O
a O
few O
years O
, O
but O
eventually O
the O
effects O
became O
less O
pronounced O
. O

I O
'm O
now O
on O
humira B-DRUG
for O
the O
last O
few O
years O
and O
it O
's O
been O
going O
great O
! O

Between O
my O
medication O
and O
copious O
amounts O
of O
weed O
, O
I O
'm O
more O
of O
less O
asymptomatic O
, O
although O
sometimes O
I O
go O
through O
a O
flare B-ADR
. O

I O
'm O
even O
able O
to O
engage O
in O
work O
outs O
, O
usually O
makes O
me O
feel O
better O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O



 O
Biggest O
piece O
of O
advice O
: O
be O
open O
and O
honest O
with O
your O
doctor O
. O

While O
you O
're O
going O
through O
the O
initial O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment O
cycles O
, O
be O
sure O
to O
keep O
a O
symptom O
journal O
where O
you O
can O
record O
how O
you O
're O
feeling O
, O
then O
bring O
that O
to O
your O
appointments O
. O

It O
serves O
as O
a O
reference O
, O
and O
can O
help O
your O
doctor O
better O
treat O
you O
. O



 O
You O
got O
this O
, O
hang O
in O
there O
and O
things O
will O
get O
better O

Much O

Cimzia B-DRUG
is O
a O
biologic O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
it O
since O
November O
. O

I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
July O
- O
November O
before O
that O
. O


i O
‚Äôm O
glad O
this O
is O
working O
for O
you O
at O
the O
present O
, O
but O
50 O
days O
is O
n‚Äôt O
a O
long O
time O
. O

did O
you O
consult O
with O
your O
doctor O
before O
you O
stopped O
taking O
humira B-DRUG
? O


It O
‚Äôs O
necessary O
but O
when O
you O
‚Äôre O
in O
remission O
for O
a O
while O
your O
rheumatologist O
might O
decide O
to O
do O
something O
called O
a O
‚Äú O
drug O
holiday O
‚Äù O
. O

Before O
switching O
to O
something O
else O
or O
seeing O
how O
effective O
less O
of O
a O
dose O
is O
. O

I O
was O
around O
16 O
when O
I O
went O
on O
my O
first O
drug O
holiday O
and O
I O
had O
to O
go O
back O
on O
humira B-DRUG
after O
about O
8 O
months O
from O
being O
on O
remicade B-DRUG
infusion O
for O
4 O
years O
straight O
. O



 O
My O
doctor O
also O
told O
me O
women O
who O
plan O
to O
become O
pregnant O
will O
come O
off O
of O
it O
, O
or O
find O
another O
med O
. O

something O
like O
70 O
% O
of O
women O
feel O
the O
best O
while O
pregnant O
cause O
the O
body O
produces O
more O
fluids O
. O

It O
depends O
on O
your O
body O
and O
your O
inflammation B-ADR
. O



 O
If O
you O
have O
rheumatoid B-ADR
arthritis I-ADR
in O
some O
regard O
you O
will O
need O
an O
anti O
- O
inflammatory O
to O
lessen O
your O
white O
blood O
cells O
but O
even O
still O
you O
‚Äôll O
be O
in O
pain B-ADR
if O
you O
do O
n‚Äôt O
exercise O
all O
of O
the O
time O
and O
dedicate O
your O
diet O
to O
replace O
meds O
. O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
recommend O
ever O
coming O
off O
a O
medication O
if O
you O
can O
help O
it O
and O
always O
plan O
with O
your O
doctor O
. O

For O
me O
, O
the O
inflammation B-ADR
is O
in O
my O
eyes O
, O
so O
I O
can O
not O
even O
begin O
to O
gamble O
medication O
unless O
told O
to O
do O
so O
. O


Oh O
they O
're O
helping O
! O

Just O
not O
all O
the O
way O
like O
they O
usually O
do O
. O

Without O
the O
steroids B-DRUG
I O
would O
be O
a O
lump O
rn O
, O
it O
's O
a O
terrible O
trade O
- O
off O
. O

Like O
, O
they O
took O
down O
the O
brain B-ADR
fog I-ADR
and O
my O
feet O
are O
no O
longer O
sausages O
. O

But O
my O
back B-ADR
pain I-ADR
has O
only O
been O
whacked O
down O
a O
couple O
points O
. O

It O
's O
like O
a O
" O
damned O
if O
I O
do O
, O
but O
extra O
damned O
if O
I O
do O
n't O
" O
type O
deal O
. O



 O
I O
had O
to O
switch O
off O
Humira B-DRUG
unexpectedly O
due O
to O
insurance O
issues O
( O
wanting O
to O
take O
me O
off O
weekly O
dose O
, O
which O
caused O
IBD B-ADR
flares O
) O
, O
and O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
stopped B-ADR
working I-ADR
entirely O
. O

Had O
to O
do O
a O
3 O
week O
no O
- O
biologic O
washout O
before O
starting O
Remicade B-DRUG
. O

Cue O
massive O
flare B-ADR
since O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
had O
already O
not O
been O
working O
for O
2 O
doses O
. O



 O
So O
I O
did O
the O
first O
taper O
, O
first O
few O
days O
were O
awesome O
, O
then O
I O
get O
to O
day O
5 O
( O
8 O
mg O
day O
) O
and O
it O
stops O
giving O
relief O
. O

So O
they O
just O
put O
me O
on O
steady O
prednisone B-DRUG
until O
I O
start O
Remicade B-DRUG
. O

Had O
my O
first O
dose O
of O
Remicade B-DRUG
‚Äî O
immediate O
IBD B-ADR
relief O
, O
and O
knocked O
my O
back O
down O
to O
a O
2/10 O
( O
I O
can O
live O
with O
that O
! O

! O

) O
, O
awesome O
. O

Still O
no O
IBD B-ADR
symptoms O
2 O
weeks O
later O
but O
my O
back B-ADR
pain I-ADR
is O
back O
with O
a O
vengeance O
. O



 O
Infusion O
nurse O
at O
my O
rheum O
tests O
positive O
for O
COVID O
the O
day O
of O
my O
second O
infusion O
and O
they O
have O
nobody O
else O
there O
who O
can O
do O
the O
infusing O
. O

Ca O
n't O
transfer O
my O
auth O
to O
an O
infusion O
center O
temporarily O
either O
because O
my O
insurance O
is O
awful O
. O



 O
So O
back O
on O
the O
taper O
. O

That O
's O
all O
to O
say O
, O
there O
's O
a O
plan O
to O
get O
me O
off O
these O
. O

I O
just O
need O
my O
nurse O
to O
get O
better O
:( O
I O
'm O
getting O
a O
call O
Monday O
to O
reschedule O
and O
I O
'll O
be O
running O
over O
if O
they O
can O
get O
me O
in O
that O
day O
. O


I O
broke O
out O
in O
hives B-ADR
from O
humira B-DRUG
. O

That O
was O
after O
my O
2nd O
dose O
. O

Did O
not O
continue O
taking O
it O
. O

Switched O
to O
Enbrel B-DRUG
and O
had O
good O
results O
for O
a O
long O
time O

Yeah O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
but O
the O
twitches O
started O
way O
before O
and O
have O
continued O
after O
I O
started O
treatment O
( O
I O
‚Äôve O
been O
on O
it O
for O
1 O
year O
and O
a O
half O
) O


 O
I O
‚Äôm O
pretty O
sure O
mine O
are O
related O
to O
vitamin B-ADR
D I-ADR
deficiency I-ADR
though O
. O


Humira B-DRUG
has O
been O
  O
amazing O
for O
reducing O
the O
chronic O
hip O
and O
knee B-ADR
pain I-ADR
. O

  O
However O
, O
I O
have O
become O
extremely O
sensitive O
to O
the O
sun O
. O

We O
may O
adjust O
my O
dose O
or O
add O
something O
that O
may O
help O
. O

But O
at O
this O
point O
I O
'd O
live O
in O
a O
cave O
because O
the O
benefits O
outweigh O
the O
issue O
. O


I O
am O
with O
you O
. O

Hang O
in O
there O
. O

Keep O
going O
and O
keep O
telling O
your O
doctors O
how O
you O
are O
feeling O
. O

If O
you O
‚Äôre O
not O
getting O
the O
responses O
you O
want O
then O
find O
a O
new O
doc O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
so O
taxing O
financially O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
. O

Maybe O
they O
can O
move O
up O
your O
humira B-DRUG
or O
maybe O
it O
‚Äôs O
time O
for O
a O
new O
biologic O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
a O
horrible O
horrible O
disease O
and O
you O
are O
not O
alone O
. O

It O
will O
not O
be O
like O
this O
forever O
. O

You O
will O
find O
relief O
even O
if O
it O
means O
surgery O
, O
which O
I O
know O
is O
terrifying O
. O

It O
scares O
me O
but O
it O
comforts O
me O
knowing O
that O
on O
my O
worst O
day O
I O

an O
option O

What O
's O
actually O
happening O
though O
, O
is O
the O
corporations O
can O
get O
away O
with O
saying O
they O
are O
n't O
actually O
charging O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
medication O
itself O
, O
but O
for O
the O
dispersal O
process O
of O
the O
medication O
. O

You O
know O
that O
" O
pen O
" O
you O
use O
for O
at O
- O
home O
injections O
such O
as O
insulin O
or O
Humira B-DRUG
( O
the O
one O
I O
take O
myself O
) O
? O

THAT O
is O
what O
they O
are O
selling O
, O
since O
they O
have O
a O
patent O
on O
the O
pen O
itself O
. O

Each O
one O
of O
those O
pens O
are O
designed O
slightly O
different O
from O
one O
another O
so O
they O
can O
charge O
out O
the O
ass O
, O
because O
if O
anyone O
else O
uses O
their O
design O
, O
there O
are O
lawsuits O
involved O
. O



 O
Humira B-DRUG
without O
insurance O
is O
more O
than O
$ O
6,000 O
a O
month O
for O
2 O
injections O
. O

Now O
to O
be O
fair O
, O
they O
do O
use O
a O
different O
* O
type O
* O
of O
medication O
, O
but O
that O
huge O
price O
has O
almost O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
medication O
itself O
. O

They O
charge O
so O
much O
" O
because O
they O
can O
" O
. O

That O
's O
just O
how O
the O
system O
works O
. O



 O
It O
's O
also O
because O
of O
insurance O
companies O
, O
or O
even O
government O
- O
run O
insurance O
. O

The O
pharms O
can O
charge O
ridiculous O
prices O
to O
insurance O
because O
insurance O
will O
pay O
for O
it O
, O
and O
give O
you O
a O
" O
better O
" O
deal O
for O
your O
medication O
. O

But O
if O
that O
middle O
man O
( O
insurance O
) O
was O
n't O
there O
to O
begin O

you O

probably O
never O
have O
these O
stupid O
prices O
to O
begin O
with O

I O
use O
humira B-DRUG
every O
17 O

Humira B-DRUG
and O

Cortisone B-DRUG

I O
've O

adalimumab B-DRUG

. O

Zero O
side O

Self O

n't O
fun O
but O
they O
made O
it O
easy O
and O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O



 O
I O
'm O
pretty O
happy O
with O
the O

I O

almost O
everything O

reasonable O
with O
quantities O
. O


I O
had O
the O
same O
reaction B-ADR
. O

Cimzia B-DRUG
was O
a O
miracle O
drug O
for O
me O
. O

I O
hope O
it O
is O
for O
you O

  O
I O
did O
have O
to O
change O
to O
Humira B-DRUG
after O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
. O

RA O
is O
a O
hard O
disorder O
. O

No O
doubt O
about O
that O
. O

But O
there O
are O
good O
drugs O
now O
that O
help O
. O

Thank O
heaven O
. O

I O
have O
no O
clue O
how O
people O
managed O
RA O
before O
. O

An O
some O
change O
have O
been O
good O
. O

I O
Sleep O
or O
rest O
when O
I O
am O
tired O
. O

I O
avoid O
stress O
. O

If O
something O
hurts B-ADR
, O
I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
do O
it O
. O

  O
I O
ask O
for O
help O
. O

I O
buy O
gadgets O
that O
help O
. O

Jar O
openers O
. O

Anything O
that O
helps O
, O
I O
buy O
. O

I O
have O
to O
limit O
computer O
and O
cell O
phone O
time O
. O

My O
hands O
and O
arms O
kill O
me O
if O
I O
am O
on O
too O
long O
. O

I O
use O
light O
weight O
dishes O
and O
pots O
and O
silverware O
. O

And O
I O
seek O
support O
from O
this O
board O
. O

And O
other O
boards O
. O

Life O
is O
okay O
now O
. O

I O
do O
n‚Äôt O
take O
good O
days O
for O
granted O
. O

  O
I O
miss O
some O
stuff O
- O
riding O
my O
bike O
is O
a O
big O
one O
. O

And O
But O
I O
am O
grateful O
for O
everything O
I O
can O
do O
. O

So O
there O
‚Äôs O
that O
. O

I O
can O
pet O
my O
dog O
. O

Take O
her O
for O
walks O
. O

Those O
were O
n‚Äôt O
possible O
for O
a O
while O
. O

I O
can O
drive O
again O
! O

! O

  O
Life O
will O
change O
. O

But O
when O
you O
find O
the O
treatment O
that O
works O
for O
you O
, O
it O
is O
a O
miracle O
everyday O
. O


I O
use O
topical O
CBD B-DRUG
cream O
on O
pain B-ADR
areas O
. O

I O
used O
it O
twice O
a O
day O
when O
I O
was O
on O
naproxen B-DRUG
and O
now O
only O
as O
needed O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
- O
just O
because O
I O
have O
less O
pain B-ADR
days O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
overall O
. O

But O
if O
you O
‚Äôre O
starting O
new O
meds O
, O
I O
‚Äôd O
personally O
advise O
waiting O
just O
so O
you O
can O
tell O
what O
‚Äôs O
really O
working O
and O
what O
‚Äôs O
not O
. O


I O
tried O
CellCept B-DRUG
and O
Imuran B-DRUG
first O
before O
moving O
to O
humira B-DRUG
. O

Even O
with O
the O
humira B-DRUG
I O
was O
still O
getting O
trace O
cells O
and O
by O
this O
point O
even O
mild O
inflammation B-ADR
was O
causing O
my O
pressures O
to O
skyrocket O
. O

Doc O
said O
I O
have O
Posner O
- O
Schlossman O
which O
causes O
massive O
IOP O
even O
with O
minimal O
inflammation B-ADR
. O

One O
good O
thing O
about O
the O
tubes O
is O
it O
helps O
clear O
out O
that O
inflammatory O
debris O
and O
I O
have O
n‚Äôt O
had O
any O
flares B-ADR
since O
then O
. O



 O
I O
have O
n‚Äôt O
had O
any O
side O
effects O
from O
the O
humira B-DRUG
except O
I O
did O
get O
shingles B-ADR
and O
had O
to O
stop O
for O
a O
couple O
weeks O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
really O
not O
giving O
up O
, O
it O
‚Äôs O
just O
a O
medicine O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
chronic O
condition O
like O
insulin B-DRUG
and O
diabetes B-ADR
. O


I O
tested O
positive O
6/27 O
, O
had O
to O
skip O
my O
humira B-DRUG
scheduled O
for O
7/4 O
which O
definitely O
led O
to O
a O
flare B-ADR
up I-ADR
that O
was O
n‚Äôt O
fun O
. O

I O
got O
to O
take O
my O
humira B-DRUG
a O
week O
ago O
on O
7/18 O
. O

I O
‚Äôve O
had O
no O
problems O
related O
to O
covid O
and O
my O
AS O
symptoms O
are O
fading O
away O
. O

I O
was O
worried O
too O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
alright O
. O

I O
hope O
it O
works O
out O
for O
you O
as O
well O
! O


When O
I O
asked O
my O
rheumatologist O
what O
to O
expect O
from O
treatment O
in O
2013 O
she O
told O
me O
that O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
predict O
how O
well O
I O
can O
get O
so O
the O
goal O
is O
to O
see O
no O
disease B-ADR
progression I-ADR
, O
low O
/ O
no O
inflammation B-ADR
, O
and O
feel O
" O
good O
enough O
" O
. O

Perfect O
was O
not O
a O
goal O
. O

On O
humira B-DRUG
and O
MTX B-DRUG
, O
all O
my O
scalp B-ADR
psoriasis I-ADR
went O
away O
( O
glory O
hallelujah O
) O
, O
I O
developed O
hand O
psoriasis B-ADR
for O
the O
first O
time O
ever O
, O
and O
I O
physically O
felt O
so O
good O
that O
I O
was O
running O
and O
jumping O
and O
everything O
. O

But O
I O
dealt O
with O
persistent O
, O
mild O
bursitis B-ADR
in O
my O
shoulders O
. O

It O
was O
obnoxious O
but O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
body O
felt O
amazing O
. O



 O
When O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
humira B-DRUG
because O
of O
MS B-ADR
, O
I O
was O
still O
feeling O
really O
well O
PsA O
wise O
( O
MS B-ADR
wise O
... O
no O
) O
. O

I O
had O
to O
do O
a O
3 O
month O
wash O
out O
and O
I O
got O
SICK B-ADR
. O

Both O
PsA O
and O
MS B-ADR
symptoms B-ADR
flared O
up O
. O

Within O
one O
week O
of O
starting O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
, O
I O
was O
feeling O
better O
. O

Completely O
unexpected O
because O
it O
is O
  O
3 O
month O
to O
be O
truly O
effective O
med O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
three O
months O
I O
continued O
to O
get O
better O

  O
Hand O
psoriasis B-ADR
gone O
, O
bursitis B-ADR
gone O
, O
and O
my O
MS B-ADR
symptoms O
settled O
/ O
went O
away O
. O

I O
've O
never O
felt O
as O
good O
as O
I O
feel O
on O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
. O

  O
It O
is O
such O
a O
good O
match O
for O
me O
. O



 O
I O
did O
n't O
start O
an O
MS B-ADR
med O
till O
August O
2020 O
because O
my O
diagnostics O
got O
delayed O
due O
to O
COVID O
. O

Neurologist O
wanted O
to O
take O
me O
off O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
and O
put O
me O
on O
an O
MS B-ADR
that O
had O
" O
strong O
evidence O
" O
that O
it O
would O
manage O
the O
PsA. O
I O
had O
a O
breakdown O
. O

Neurologist O
decided O
to O
put O
me O
on O
a O
mild O
MS O
med O
and O
keep O
me O
on O
Xeljanz B-DRUG
. O

Xeljanz B-DRUG
is O
new O
so O
not O
a O
ton O
is O
known O
about O
its O
effects O
on O
other O
autoimmune B-ADR
issues I-ADR
but O
it O
seems O
to O
have O
quieted O
my O
immune O
system O
enough O
that O
the O
MS B-ADR
was O
settled O
. O

So O
I O
will O
stay O
on O
this O
combo O
until O
the O
MS B-ADR
progresses O
( O
no O
new O
lesions O
since O
they O
found O
them O
in O
2019 O
) O

My O
wife O
has O
the O
option O
to O
select O
humira B-DRUG
, O
entyvio B-DRUG
, O
or O
stelara B-DRUG

GI O
team O

much O
information O

so O
thanks O
everyone O
for O

your O

like O
most O
of O
you O
have O
had O
the O

success O
with O

yes O
. O

Ivermectin B-DRUG
( O
when O
prescribed O
through O
a O
retail O
pharmacy O
) O
is O
dirt O
cheap O
, O
especially O
compared O
to O
all O
the O
" O
miracle O

" O
that O
are O
on O

 O
Does O
n't O
take O
a O
tin O
foil O
hat O
conspiracy O
nut O
to O
realize O
that O
big O
pharma O
is O
in O
it O
for O
the O
money O
, O
not O
for O
efficacy O
or O
the O
end O
result O
if O
the O
new O
drug O
costs O
thousands O
and O
the O
off O

costs O
a O
couple O
bucks O
a O

 O
Humira B-DRUG

used O
to O
cost O
me O
around O
1000.00 O
a O
dose O
way O
back O
when O
. O

Why O
not O
sell O
that O
to O
the O
ppl O
vs O
something O
that O
works O
better O
at O
1/10 O
the O
price O
? O

You O
and O
I O
may O
not O
think O
like O
that O
, O
but O
they O
seem O
to O
. O



 O
Remember O
, O
these O
are O
the O
same O
people O
who O
said O
oxicontin O
was O
safe O
and O
non O
- O
addictive B-ADR
, O
creating O
a O
generation O
of O

physically O
dependent O
" O
customers O
" O

It O
‚Äôs O
not O
much O
, O
standard O
for O
HS O
, O
but O
things O
that O
are O
so O
much O
harder O
because O
of O
the O
Japanese O
system O
. O

We O
‚Äôve O
added O
a O
topical O
clindamyacin B-DRUG
( O
which O
has O
ever O
been O
tried O
for O
me O
in O
the O
20 O
years O
I O
‚Äôve O
had O
HS O
for O
some O
reason O
‚Ä¶ O
but O
that O
‚Äôs O
just O
for O
management O
) O
, O
we O
‚Äôre O
also O
trying O
spironolactone B-DRUG
again O
. O

I O
tried O
it O
14 O
years O
ago O
but O
could O
not O
get O
to O
a O
therapeutic O
level O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
willing O
to O
see O
if O
I O
have O
the O
same O
side O
effects O
. O

Last O
was O
a O
prescription O
for O
Ocella B-DRUG
( O
Yasm√≠n B-DRUG
) O
, O
I O
had O
to O
quit O
BC B-DRUG
because O
of O
PMDD B-ADR
and O
noticed O
my O
HS O
got O
worse O
after O
. O

Since O
this O
one O
treats O
PMDD B-ADR
we O
‚Äôre O
hoping O
it O
might O
help O
. O

Japan O
is O
very O
limited O
in O
the O
types O
of O
BC O
I O
can O
get O
so O
this O
was O
the O
best O
way O
to O
get O
it O
. O



 O
Now O
, O
the O
local O
pharmacy O
was O
not O
happy O
at O
filling O
these O
three O
with O
a O
year O
supply O
at O
out O
of O
pocket O

 O
We O
did O
talk O
about O
therapies O
they O
would O
try O
if O
I O
was O
in O
the O
US O

here O
: O

- O
Increase O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
dosage O
to O
80mg O
/ O
week O

- O
Try O
Cosentryx B-DRUG

of O
Humira B-DRUG

 O
She O
was O

end O
up O

with O
me O
that O

is O
n‚Äôt O

A O
scope O
is O
pretty O
much O
the O
gold O
standard O
test O
for O
diagnosis O
. O

Regarding O
the O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
it O
might O
help O
Crohns O
but O
it O
also O
might O
not O
. O

Certain O
biologics O
do O
n‚Äôt O
work O
for O
everyone O
and O
if O
they O
do O
work O
, O
they O
might O
not O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
they O
should O
be O
and O
you O
can O
also O
simply O
lose O
response O
to O
them O
. O


On O
Humira B-DRUG
and O
noticed O
improvement O
( O
while O
also O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
and O
methotrexate B-DRUG
) O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
. O

Loading O
dose O
of O
Humira B-DRUG
pretty O
high O
though O
. O


The O
first O
biologic O
for O
RA O
( O
Enbrel B-DRUG
) O
was O
approved O
in O
1998 O
. O

Methotrexate B-DRUG
began O
being O
used O
for O
RA O
in O
1988 O
. O

Apparently O
he O
did O
n't O
have O
an O
issue O
with O
using O
a O
" O
new O
treatment O
" O
33 O
years O
ago O
, O
lol O
. O



 O
I O
used O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
for O
about O
2 O
months O
in O
2021 O
. O

About O
6 O
weeks O
in O
I O
developed O
a O
staph O
infection B-ADR
on O
my O
skin O
and O
had O
to O
discontinue O
the O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
until O
it O
was O
cleared O
up O
. O

I O
lasted O
another O
2 O
weeks O
before O
developing O
a O
cough B-ADR
that O
a O
2 O
pack O
a O
day O
smoker O
would O
be O
proud O
of O
. O

My O
rheumatologist O
pulled O
me O
off O
Rinvoq B-DRUG
at O
that O
time O
. O



 O
I O
've O
been O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
since O
and O
am O
tolerating O
it O
well O
. O

Wishing O
your O
dad O
the O
best O
of O
luck O
. O


There O
is O
concern O
what O
it O
can O
do O
someone O
who O
wants O
to O
be O
pregnant O
. O

Even O
men O
are O
cautioned O
at O
waiting O
3 O
months O
of O
stopping O
mtx O
before O
fathering O
a O
child O
. O

However O
Humira B-DRUG
could O
affect O
the O
reproductive O
system O
in O
ways O
we O
do O
n‚Äôt O
know O
in O
both O
men O
and O
women O
. O

Personally O
as O
a O
30 O
M O
without O
children O
this O
side O
effect O
does O
n‚Äôt O
bother O
me O
. O

It O
‚Äôs O
really O
up O
to O
you O
. O



 O
Humira B-DRUG
works O
without O
DMARDs O
but O
it O
will O
be O
slower O
to O
work O
. O

You O
should O
find O
one O
that O
works O
for O
you O
. O

Using O
a O
pill O
divider O
will O
help O
you O
remember O
to O
take O
your O
pills O
. O


I O
‚Äôm O
in O
Japan O
. O

I O
pay O
into O
NHI O
, O
and O
get O
a O
low O
income O
qualification O
that O
limits O
my O
max O
healthcare O
costs O
to O
around O
$ O
800 O
a O
month O
. O

My O
doctor O
and O
I O
plan O
my O
Humira B-DRUG
carefully O
so O
I O
can O
get O
3 O
months O
at O
a O
time O
, O
so O
I O
get O
12 O
doses O
for O
the O
$ O
800 O
. O

So O
still O
not O
as O
cheap O
as O
some O
of O
the O
programs O
as O
America O
but O
much O
more O
stable O
. O

I O
never O
worry O
I O
‚Äôll O
get O
dropped O
. O


Diagnosed O
6 O
weeks O
ago O
, O
I O
suspect O
I O
was O
dealing O
with O
it O
for O
about O
12months O
before O
diagnosis O
. O

Every O
single O
morning O
I O
would O
wake O
up O
with O
stiff O
and O
sore B-ADR
joints I-ADR
. O

Fingers O
, O
wrists O
, O
ankles O
, O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
I O
would O
have O
excruciating O
pain B-ADR
in O
my O
shoulders O
. O

Used O
to O
have O
to O
use O
my O
right O
arm O
to O
lift O
my O
left O
arm O
to O
pay O
the O
lady O
in O
the O
drive O
thru O
. O

Yeah O
that O
much O
pain B-ADR
in O
my O
shoulder O
. O

I O
would O
walk O
down O
the O
stairs O
after O
getting O
up O
from O
bed O
and O
could O
n‚Äôt O
put O
weight O
on O
my O
ankles O
. O

After O
a O
shower O
I O
was O
mobile O
but O
still O
stiff B-ADR
. O

I O
was O
prescribed O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
took O
it O
at O
5 O
pm O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
very O
next O
morning O
I O
was O
pain O
free O
and O
have O
been O
for O
6 O
weeks O
. O

It O
was O
almost O
euphoric O
that O
first O
few O
days O
. O

You O
never O
truly O
know O
how O
much O
pain B-ADR
you O
‚Äôre O
in O
until O
all O
the O
pain B-ADR
is O
gone O
. O


I O
was O
13/14 O
( O
I O
think O
? O

Hard O
to O
remember O
) O
, O
24 O
now O
. O



 O
I O
tried O
Humira B-DRUG
a O
few O
years O
ago O
and O
felt O
like O
a O
new O
person O
. O

Unfortunately O
miscommunication O
between O
my O
rheumatologist O
( O
auto O
immune O
in O
my O
joints O
) O
and O
gastro O
( O
auto O
immune O
Crohns O
) O
meant O
I O
was O
switched O
to O
Ustek O
for O
about O
6 O
months O
, O
which O
did O
n‚Äôt O
help O
much O
at O
all O
. O



 O
I O
was O
approved O
to O
go O
back O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
early O
this O
year O
and O
am O
so O
greatful O
. O



 O
It O
‚Äôs O
hard O
, O
too O
, O
though O
. O



 O
I O
‚Äôve O
lost O
about O
10 O
years O
of O
socialisation O
and O
proper O
education O
. O

I O
‚Äôm O
doing O
okay O
for O
myself O
but O
I O
mourn O
who O
I O
could O
have O
been O
. O

Finding O
a O
treatment O
that O
works O
is O
a O
double O
edged O
sword- O
as O
soon O
as O
my O
body O
stopped O
fighting O
itself O
my O
mind O
got O
clearer O
and O
I O
started O
to O
process O
the O
last O
10 O
+ O
years O
. O

The O
fear O
, O
trauma O
, O
isolation O
, O
that O
came O
with O
& O
leading O
up O
to O
my O
Crohns O
. O



 O
I O
m O
really O
hoping O
to O
speak O
to O
an O
immune O
psychologist O
at O
some O
point O
. O

The O
change O
between O
flairing O
and O
not O
has O
such O
a O
huge O
mental O
impact O
on O
me O
that O
I O
‚Äôm O
terrified O
, O
quite O
often O
, O
that O
if O
I O
lose O
my O
medication O
( O
again O
) O
I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
daily O
panics O
and O
spirals O
. O



 O
Glad O
for O
remission O
, O
none O
the O
less O
. O


I O
‚Äôve O
been O
in O
a O
flair O
for O
over O
a O
year O
, O
tried O
mesalamine B-DRUG
too O
and O
my O
case O
was O
too O
severe O
for O
it O
. O

On O
Humira B-DRUG
now O
since O
late O
November O
, O
still O
not O
in O
remission O
but O
a O
whole O
lot O
better O
overall O

Thank O
you O
for O
sharing O
! O

So O
sorry O
for O
what O
you O
‚Äôve O
been O
dealt O

but O
I O

to O
hear O
your O
pain B-ADR
is O
almost O
entirely O
well O
controlled O
! O

That O
‚Äôs O
awesome O
. O

If O
you O
do O

adalimumab B-DRUG
injections O
